<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>This book was begun at Oxford before the War,
when I had the great privilege of being a student
in Sir Walter Raleigh’s class. Through his generous
encouragement, it was continued at intervals and under
many difficulties; and if he had not found some things
to like in it, I should hardly venture to put it forth in its
present shape.</p>

<p>It is true that the interest of great men in little books
(a token of romance since the eighteenth century) is no
gauge of public favour; but the history of children’s books
is in some sort a record of childhood. Lovers of children
may be willing to look through the shelves of old nurseries,
if only for the portraits.</p>

<p>The farther one goes upon such small business, the more
intricate it seems; and although I began with some knowledge
of the treasures that Mrs. Field had unearthed in her
study of <i>The Child and His Book</i>, I had no idea there were
so many of these books, or that I should find it so difficult
to choose. In this I was helped by the older reprints, by
the collections of Mr. E. V. Lucas, and later by Mr. Harvey
Darton’s chapter in the <i>Cambridge History of English
Literature</i>.</p>

<p>The book itself is a poor acknowledgment of my gratitude
to Oxford: to Sir Charles Firth and Mr. Nichol Smith
for their advice and criticism; to the late Mr. R. J. E.
Tiddy and Mr. Percy Simpson for help in the early stages;
to Miss Helen Darbishire, Miss Janet Spens, and not least
to my fellow students at Somerville who, in the midst of
serious things, found time to be amused.</p>

<h1>A CENTURY<br />
OF CHILDREN’S BOOKS</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>To open a child’s book nowadays is to discover some
part of that unknown world which touches experience
at so many points. The city beyond
the clouds, the underground country, all the enchantments
of woods and islands are open to the little traveller.
From <i>The Water Babies</i> to <i>Peter Pan</i> there has been little
else in nursery tales but the stuff of dreams.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that the child who read the story of
Rosamond and the Purple Jar, less than a hundred years
ago, had no curiosity about dream countries, no sense of
poetry in nature; yet the first sign of a romantic movement
in children’s books was the printing of unknown or forgotten
fairy tales under the title of <i>The Court of Oberon</i>,
in 1823. The actual awakening came later, with the
nature stories of the Howitts and the imaginative nonsense
of Edward Lear.</p>

<p>A century of little books had passed before a child could
read fairy tales without shame, and the taste for true
“histories” prevailed long after Miss Edgeworth had
written her last sequel.</p>

<p>For although there were eighteenth century chap-books
that kept alive old tales of chivalry, these had no proper
place on the nursery shelves. Books written for children
were always designed to instruct as well as to amuse, and
it was only because the human interests of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
century included children that it became a century of
children’s books.</p>

<p>Those that survived the use of their first owners,—a little
company in old sheepskin or flowered paper covers,—are
either treasured by collectors or hidden away in some old
library; but some of the best are still to be had in reprints
and collections of “Old-fashioned” or “Forgotten”
children’s books.</p>

<p>The new generation, pressing forward to discover more
of the dream country, cares little for tales that reflect
the quiet schooling of its ancestors; yet the most moral
and instructive of these books mark the child’s escape from
a sterner school. It was on his way to the Child’s Garden
that he passed through this town of Georgian dolls’ houses,
where, indeed, he found some rare and curious things.</p>

<p>In the earlier centuries a child made shift with such
tales as his elders chose to tell him. There were few books
that he could call his own, and those were devised to
advance him in knowledge or courtesy. Yet the monks
of the eleventh and twelfth centuries had a way of turning
the natural instincts of children to account. They taught
Latin by means of imaginary conversations, and put the
raw material of wonder tales into their instructive “Elucidarium”,
a sort of primitive “Child’s Guide” which
told of fabulous beasts and gave miraculous accounts of
heaven and earth.</p>

<p>The successors of these old schoolmasters devised a
book for parents which they might share with their children.
This was the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, a collection of
stories put together in Latin about the fourteenth century
to serve as texts for “Moralities”. It became the popular
story-book of the Middle Ages, and a woodcut in the
early editions shows a whole family gathered round the
fire on a winter night telling stories to pass the time.</p>

<p>This was no book for children, even in the days before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
nurseries; yet it contained variants of the Arabian Tales,
a story that Chaucer afterwards used for his “History of
Constance”, and two strands of the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>
plot.</p>

<p>Travellers’ tales, also shared between men and children,
filled a gap between the truthful records of King Alfred
and Caxton’s new-discovered wealth of romance. Marco
Polo and other voyagers brought back stories and fables
from the East; Sir John Mandeville wrote of “the
Meruayles of Ynde and of other diuerse Coûtries”. These
cross the border between truth and fancy much as
children do; but children knew them only from hearsay.</p>

<p>Caxton alone, had he been so minded, could have filled
a child’s library; for besides his <i>Recuyell of the Historyes
of Troye</i>, he printed Sir Thomas Malory’s <i>Noble Histories
of King Arthur</i> with many romances of his own translating
and legends and lives of Saints. He was actually the
first printer and editor of the very books which Locke, in
the eighteenth century, prescribed for children: Æsop’s
<i>Fables</i> and <i>The History of Reynard the Fox</i>; but Caxton
intended none of these for children. The <i>Fables</i> showed
men their follies; and <i>Reynard</i> was then a satire that ridiculed
unjust rulers under the figures of beasts. For
children, he chose the kind of books that their parents would
buy: the instructive <i>Parvus et Magnus Chato</i>, with its
woodcut print of a monastery school; <i>Stans Puer ad Mensam</i>,
a museum of quaint formalities, and <i>The Book of
Courtesy</i>, addressed to “Lytyl John” in “tendre
enfancye”.</p>

<p>Thus early did grown-up persons monopolise the
pleasures of fiction, while they prepared handbooks of
learning and courtesy for youth. Chaucer, it will be
remembered, wrote a scientific treatise instead of a story
for his little boy; and <i>The Babees Book</i>, designed for the
royal wards and pages of the fifteenth century, had not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
word of romance or fable; nothing but precepts of fair
behaviour, and lessons that should teach those “Bele
Babees” how to give their reasons smoothly, “in words
that are gentle but compendious”.</p>

<p>There were many such books, nor were they all confined
to children of gentle birth. <i>The Book of Courtesy</i> was for
the sons “of gentleman, yeoman or knave”, and Symon’s
<i>Lesson of Wisdom</i> (1500) “for all manner children”.</p>

<p>As for Caxton’s successors, they were content with his
ideas about children’s books; it was simply a choice
between manners and learning. Wynkyn de Worde,
though he printed the splendid romance of <i>Bevis of Southampton</i>,
gave his child-readers a “Wyse Chylde of Thre
Year Old” that could answer the fearful question: “Sage
enfaunt, how is the skye made?”; and William Copland
produced <i>The Secret of Secrets of Aristotle</i>, “very good to
teach children to read English”, while he lavished the
adventures of Guy of Warwick upon their parents.</p>

<p>It is true that the child of the sixteenth century had
much to compensate him for a lack of books. If he dwelt
in the country, he saw <i>Robin Hood</i> and <i>St. George</i> played
out upon the village green, or if in a town, he might meet
with strange merchantmen in any street. He lived in an
age of practical romance, and could match you the exploits
of Guy or Bevis any day from the adventures of his neighbours.
Moreover the Elizabethan child, if he could not
read the old stories, at least had a chance of hearing them
set to a new measure. Puttenham in his <i>Art of English
Poesie</i> (1589) writes of the “Blind Harpers and such like
taverne Minstrels” who sang “stories of old time” to
ballad tunes: “the tale of Sir Topas, the reportes of Bevis
of Southampton, Guy of Warwick, Adam Bell and Clymme
of the Clough, and such other old romances or historical
rimes”.</p>

<p>But a boy had to evade his schoolmaster before he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
listen to such things; and the schoolmaster saw to it that
he had no English story-books. The new learning, which
poured out its treasures for scholars, meant little more to
the average boy than longer hours of study and more
stripes; and reformers in education, although they looked
upon him as a creature of promise, and were concerned to
make his lot more bearable, came no nearer than their
predecessors to the secrets of his mind.</p>

<p>Companies of schoolboy-players,—the children of the
Chapel, or of Paul’s—might make the most of such plays
as they could understand; and the Queen’s wards had times
of “honest recreation” when they might tell each other
stories; but their hours with tutors and music-masters
would astonish the youth of these days.</p>

<p>Perhaps the happiest child of the great age of romance
was the truant who could follow some pedlar along the road.
For the pedlar’s songs were more enthralling than his
“unbraided wares”; and he had ballads, such as “The
Two Children in the Wood” and “Chevy Chace”, that a
child could paste upon his nursery walls.</p>

<p>There was at least one writer who recognised the pedlar’s
claims, and made him the hero of an instructive book.
This was Thomas Newberry, who in 1563 wrote “A booke
in English metre, of the great Marchaunt man called Dives
Pragmaticus, very pretye for chyldren to rede: wherby
they may the better, and more readyer, rede and wryte
Wares and Implements, in this World contayned”.</p>

<p>This merchant knows all crafts and deals in every kind
of wares; but he does it in the manner of Autolycus,
calling all men to come and buy. His “Inkyll, crewell
and gay valances fine” perhaps made copy for <i>A Winter’s
Tale</i>; his “ouches, brooches and fine aglets for Kynges”
might lie in the pack with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perfume for a lady’s chamber”;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">and though he had neither songs nor ballads, he spoke in
verse and could find poetry in the “chyselle” and “blade”
which Stevenson, more than three centuries later, praised
in his <i>Child’s Garden</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A chisel, both handle and blade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which <i>a man who was really a carpenter made</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was a hard day for the men of the road when the
Roundhead prevailed over King Charles. Had the Puritans
been gifted with the worldly wisdom of old religious
orders, the pedlar’s songs, interpreted as allegories, would
have passed, with a word or two altered here and there;
as it was, many of these poor merchants were reduced to
carrying tracts that reflected the gloomy spirit of the times.
But the seventeenth century garlands still preserved some
of the older ballads, and the true Autolycus was never
without copies of <i>Tom Thumb</i>, <i>The Wise Men of Gotham</i>,
and other chap-books for the unregenerate. He suffered
the penalties of rogues and vagabonds, and the child shared
his disgrace.</p>

<p>George Fox, in his <i>Warning to all Teachers</i>, condemns,
among other sins of children, “the telling of Tales, Stories,
Jests, Rhimes and Fables”. The doctrine of Original Sin
left no hope of grace by means of books. Courtesy, as
concerning the mere outward forms and carriage of a
child, was held of no account, and instruction itself was
abandoned in favour of “Emblems”, “Warnings”, and
morbid “Examples for Youth”: such books, for example,
as James Janeway’s <i>Token for Children</i>, which contained
“an exact account of the conversion, holy and exemplary
lives and joyful deaths of several young children”: a
literature of denial and negation.</p>

<p>And yet the greatest child’s book of the age was written
by a Puritan. John Bunyan was the first to reconcile the
claims of religion and romance, and he never could have
written <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i> if he had not been a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
customer of the pedlar in his youth. But in writing it,
Bunyan had no more thought of children than Caxton when
he printed the stories of King Arthur. Both were thinking
of grown-up children. And when, some eight years later,
Bunyan tried his hand at a <i>Book for Boys and Girls</i>, he made
it a mere collection of “Emblems” in doggerel verse. The
alternative title, <i>Country Rhimes for Children</i>, seems to
refer to certain farmyard creatures which he introduced to
point analogies even more absurd than those of the old
monkish Bestiaries; but the monks had sirens and other
wonderful things in their natural history. There is
nothing to atone for the dulness of these rhymes; any
child would be better entertained in the Interpreter’s
House.</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the pedlar had a better market for
his books, but he also came upon new enemies; for it was
then that members of the Royal Society were beginning
to question those “strange and wonderful Relations”
which simple folk, seeing them in print, received as true.</p>

<p>When Shakespeare’s shepherdess asked the pedlar “Is
it true, think you?” he answered “Five justices’ hands at
it, and witnesses more than my pack will hold”; but these
men of letters and science accepted no evidence save that
of their own reason, and this was fatal to the common
matter of chap-books. It is the more surprising that one
of their number should have been an unacknowledged
maker of children’s books.</p>

<p>John Locke was the first to apply the methods of the
Royal Society to education. He cared neither for creeds
nor grammars, followed Montaigne in denouncing the
pedantry of the old schoolmasters, and held with Rabelais
that “the greatest clerks are not the wisest men.”</p>

<p>It is true that his concern for literal truth made him a
very imperfect reader of children’s minds. He never
understood the part that imagination plays in a child’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
life, and his plan of education allows no scope for it; yet
he understood children so well on the practical side that
every eighteenth century writer of little books quoted his
maxims, despised romance and produced “fables” that
made a certain appeal to childish interests while they
proved the advantages of common sense.</p>

<p>Locke’s book, <i>Some Thoughts concerning Education</i>,
which he published in 1693, was put together from the
letters he had written during his exile in Holland, to
Edward Clarke; but it suggests notes rather than letters.
Locke so condenses the human element that it reads like a
book of educational prescriptions. The key is to be found
in the letters of his friends, and in the records of his pupil,
the third Lord Shaftesbury, author of the <i>Characteristics</i>.
Locke was the first earl’s friend and medical adviser,
and for a time had taught his son; the third earl came
to him as “Mr. Anthony” at the age of three, and was his
“more peculiar charge” till he was twelve years old. After
the grandfather’s death, they sent him to Westminster,
entirely against Locke’s wish, for he hated schools; but
when “Mr. Anthony” came to write about his childhood,
he had not a good word for “pedants and schoolmasters”;
only for Mr. Locke to whom, next his “immediate
parents”, he owed “the highest gratitude and duty”.</p>

<p>Men do not write thus of tutors who were not their
friends; and doubtless others could have said the same of
Locke: the younger brothers of Lord Shaftesbury, the
Dutch Quaker’s little boy, Arent Furly, a kind of foster-child
of his in Holland, or little Frank Masham, his last
pupil, who was between four and five when Locke came to
live with his family. They all owed him good health and
a happy childhood, and it does not appear that they
hankered after the forbidden joys of romance.</p>

<p>Locke’s belief in physical training was a welcome contrast
to the average tutor’s insistence upon books. He put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
aside the rod, invented games for his pupils and, as soon as
possible, treated them as “rational creatures”.</p>

<p>By reversing the order of Books of Courtesy, he relieved
them of rules and maxims. Virtue stood first in his
judgment, then wisdom, then breeding, and learning last.
At heart he was not less concerned for manners than the
old masters of courtesy; but he thought they could only
be acquired by habit and good company. It is the more
curious to find him, in another part of the book, assuming
that the right kind of tutor could teach Virtue and Wisdom
as another might teach Latin. Locke himself came as
near as a man could to his ideal of a tutor more wise than
learned, a man of the world that knew how to bear himself
in any company; and it mattered little to his pupils that
such a tutor could not be found for every child.</p>

<p>Intelligent parents found in his published <i>Thoughts</i>
some confirmation of their own experience, and his very
inconsistencies made his ideas seem the more reasonable to
them. For it cannot be denied that Locke, although he
believed in teaching children not what, but how to think,
yet fell into the error of impressing facts upon their memory,
and facts that could only be learned from books. His
Irish friend Molyneux, on whose advice the <i>Thoughts</i> were
put together, brought up his little boy according to Locke’s
plan, and proved that the system could produce a rival to
Wynkyn de Worde’s Wyse Chylde: one that at five years
old could read perfectly and trace out upon the globes “all
the noted parts, countries and cities of the world”. At
six, his knowledge was incredible, he was “obedient and
observant to the nicest particular”, and his father believed
that no child “had ever his passions more perfectly at
command”.</p>

<p>There is nothing in Locke’s theory to account for the
encyclopædic knowledge of this child; but in practice he
had replaced Latin and Greek with Geometry, Chronology,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the use of the Globes, and even some part of “the incomparable
Mr. Newton’s” Philosophy, so far as it was justified
by “Matter of Fact”.</p>

<p>This helps to explain the little pedantries of later
children’s books, although many of these do not go beyond
Locke’s directions for teaching a child to read.</p>

<p>“There may be Dice and Play-things with the letters
on them,” he says, “to teach Children the Alphabet by
Playing; and twenty other Ways may be found, suitable
to their particular Tempers, to make this Kind of Learning
a Sport to them. Thus Children may be cozen’d into a
Knowledge of the Letters....”</p>

<p>If this smacks of artifice, there is no question of his
wisdom about essentials: “If you have any Contests with
him, let it be in Matters of Moment, of Truth and Good
Nature; but lay no Task on him about A.B.C.”</p>

<p>About books he is very plain: when “by these gentle
Ways” a child begins to read, “some easy pleasant Book,
suited to his Capacity should be put into his Hands, wherein
the Entertainment that he finds might draw him on,
and reward his Pains in Reading, and yet not such as should
fill his Head with perfectly useless Trumpery, or lay the
Principles of Vice and Folly. To this purpose I think
Æsop’s Fables the best, which being Stories apt to delight
and entertain a Child, may yet afford useful Reflections
to a grown Man; and if his Memory retain them all his
Life after, he will not repent to find them there, amongst
his manly Thoughts and serious Business”.</p>

<p>Then, after recommending an <i>Æsop</i> with pictures in it,
he adds: “<i>Reynard the Fox</i> is another Book I think may
be made Use of to the same Purpose”. Talking beasts
that can be made the mouthpiece of a moralist are Locke’s
nearest approach to the supernatural. In another place,
he admonishes parents to preserve a child’s mind “from
all Impressions and Notions of <i>Spirits</i> and <i>Goblins</i>, or any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
fearful Apprehensions in the Dark”. Thus the child is
to be protected from ghost-stories or fairy-tales and
“cozen’d” into reading what will be useful to him when
he is a man.</p>

<p>Locke knew no other books in English “fit to engage
the liking of children and tempt them to read”; and
indeed there were few to know. <i>The Seven Wise Masters
of Rome</i> is an example of what was thought fit for children.
This was a very old sequence of Eastern parables first
printed by Wynkyn de Worde. Francis Kirkman, who
translated it from the French in 1674, declared that it was
“held in such estimation in Ireland that it was always
put into the hands of young children immediately after
the horn book”. English copies were common; but
the tales had less interest for children than those of the
<i>Gesta</i>. “Pedants and Schoolmasters” must have conspired
to keep it in print.</p>

<p>Thus at the close of the seventeenth century the greater
number of children, if they read anything, amused themselves
with chap-books or broadsheets,—all of which,
doubtless, came under Locke’s ban as “perfectly useless
Trumpery”; and for those that read no books, in spite of
Locke, there were still tales “of Sprites and Goblins”.</p>

</div>

<p>Steele’s account of his two god-children<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (perhaps
the choicest of his <i>Tatler</i> papers) discovers the weak
point of Locke’s philosophy. Nothing could so
shake a blind faith in Æsop as the frank words of Steele’s
little boy who, at eight years old, although he was “a
very great Historian in Æsop’s Fables”, declared “that
he did not delight in that Learning, because he did not
believe they were true”.</p>

<p>His sister Betty defied Mr. Locke upon another side,
for she dealt “chiefly in Fairies and Sprights”; and
would “terrifie the Maids with her Accounts” till they
were afraid to go up to bed.</p>

<p>Now, neither of these children had the least difficulty
about the supernatural. The boy could have believed
in beasts that talked; but he detected the man inside the
lion’s skin: the man that pointed a moral. These <i>Fables</i>,
once understood as ridiculing the follies of mankind, were
no longer “true”; but there were other stories of the
boy’s own choosing which, though full of magic, were
true to the spirit of their kind.</p>

<p>Steele says he had “very much turned his studies for
about a Twelvemonth past into the Lives and Adventures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of <i>Don Bellianis of Greece</i>, <i>Guy of Warwick</i>, the <i>Seven
Champions</i>, and other Historians of that Age”.</p>

<p>Not only does the sympathetic godfather enter into
these literary adventures, as Mr. Locke, with all his
wisdom, never could have done, but he knows the virtue
of an unpointed moral: the boy, he says, “had made
Remarks, which might be of Service to him during the
Course of his whole Life. He would tell you the Mismanagements
of <i>John Hickathrift</i>, find Fault with the
passionate Temper in <i>Bevis of Southampton</i> and loved <i>St.
George</i> for being the Champion of <i>England</i>; and by this
Means had his Thoughts insensibly moulded into the
Notions of Discretion, Virtue and Honour”.</p>

<p>In the reign of Anne, these stirring “Histories” were
a part of every pedlar’s stock-in-trade. They were sold
at fairs or hawked from door to door; and a boy that
could never stumble through the maze of a seventeenth
century folio might read as many romances as he had
halfpence. Some had been among the earliest printed
books. They were mostly from French originals, though
Sir Bevis and Sir Guy had been “<i>Chevaliers d’Angleterre</i>”
from the beginning. The chap-book <i>Seven Champions</i>
and <i>Life and Death of St. George</i> were both based on
Richard Johnson’s <i>History of the Seven Champions</i>, a
medley of other romances in which Caxton’s “Saynt
George of Capadose” had become St. George of Coventry.
But the romance spirit was cosmopolitan, born of the
Crusades, and foreign champions like Don Bellianis of
Greece were hardly less popular.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Late writers varied the old adventures; but the chap-book
printer, who did his own editing, cut down the heavy
matter of the folios to a bare chain of incidents. His
words were few and ill-chosen, he had neither style nor
grammar; but the core of interest was sound: the stories<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
touched the imagination of his readers like ballads and
fairy tales.</p>

<p>Gallant Knights came straight from the fields of France
to the magnificence of Eastern cities; youths, setting out
from the English towns, adventured among dwarfs and
Saracens, giants and dragons, and won their knighthood
by the way.</p>

<p>If the hero never failed to subdue his enemies and
win a lady of surpassing beauty, there was still a doubt
(enough to keep the reader curious) whether a rival would
snatch her from him and put him upon a more dangerous
adventure to win her back; or whether, if they fared on
together, they would meet an enchanter or a giant first.</p>

<p>Repetition seldom tires a child. The feats of Acquitaine
could be repeated at Damascus; and the wood-cuts in the
chap-books proved that Montelion and Parismus could
fight in the armour of Don Bellianis or St. George. Nor
was it a chance association of the pedlar’s pack which
threw these champions into the company of a village
strongman, John Hickathrift, more commonly called Tom;
for although Hickathrift fought with a cart-wheel and
axle-tree for shield and sword, he could beat the best of
them at giant-killing.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The romances, indeed, are full of the common stuff
of folk-lore. If the hero blow a trumpet at a castle-gate,
a giant may be expected; if he blow it at the mouth of an
enchanted cave, a prophetic voice replies, or if he enter the
cave by chance, he may find the prophecy inscribed on a
pillar of sapphire—the prelude, in <i>Don Bellianis</i>, to the
coming of the Enchantress through a pair of ivory gates.</p>

<p>A hundred folk-tales tell of the Princess rescued from
a dragon; transformation is an affair of every day: Don
Bellianis slays a magician “in the shape of a griffin”;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
St. Denis, in the <i>Seven Champions</i>, is transformed into a
hart, the Princess of Thessaly into a mulberry-tree; and
St. David sleeps seven years in an enchanted garden—the
Magic Sleep of the fairy tales. Nor is the champion
of romance without his wonderful sword or cloak.</p>

<p>The Sword “Morglay” (no more than a stout weapon
in the old version of <i>Sir Bevis</i>) is called “wonderful” in the
chap-books. Don Bellianis draws a magic sword from a
pillar, as Arthur pulled his out of the stone; St. George
has invincible armour; and the later <i>History of Fortunatus</i>
is the tale of a Wonderful Purse and a Wishing Cap.</p>

<p>But whoever looks upon a child as a pure romantic, has
learned but half his lesson; for in many tales that have
stood the test of time, there is little interest outside sheer
matter of fact; and even the romances owed something
to legendary settings which touched a borderland of
truth. To know that Bevis lived in the reign of Edgar,
that Guy, returning from his pilgrimage, found King
Athelstane at Winchester, beset by the Danes, would
confirm a child’s belief; but the little reader of chap-books
knew more than this; he could give the exact
measurements of Tom Hickathrift’s grave in Tilney
Churchyard, knew where to find Guy’s armour and his
porridge-pot at Warwick, and never doubted that Bevis
built Arundel Castle for love of his horse.</p>

<p>It might be done indeed, for such a horse: no mere
product of a wizard’s cunning, but a steed fit to carry a
champion: alive as the persons of the romances never
were. He figures in every adventure, carries the thread of
the story from point to point, and yet stands out, a very
symbol of romance.</p>

<p>The chap-book writer makes no picture of the knighting
of Bevis, and never mentions his shield with the three blue
eagles on a field of gold; but he remembers well enough
how the Saracen King’s daughter, Josian the fair, presented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Bevis with the sword “Morglay” and the “wonderful
steed called Arundel”.</p>

<p>From that point the story goes to a sound of hoofs; and
though the King betrayed Bevis into the hands of his
enemy and gave the horse Arundel to Bevis’s rival, King
Jour, and though Bevis lay in a dungeon for seven years,
Josian herself was not more faithful to him than Arundel;
for when at last he escaped, and came, disguised as a poor
pedlar, to the castle of Jour, Josian knew him not; but
Arundel, hearing his master speak, “neighed and broke
seven chains for joy”.</p>

<p>As to the men and women of romance, they borrowed
life from their adventures, but apart from these, were mere
types of strength or beauty. The original portraits,
though vague, were not without poetry: the impression
of “The Squyere Guy” has a hint of Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Feyre he was and bryght of face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He schone as bryght as ane glace.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The chap-book writer contents himself with the remark
that King Ermine was “prepossessed with Guy’s looks”.
He bestows more care on the heroine, Felyce, but covers
the faint outline with his trowel. Felyce, once</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“the Erlys Doghtur, a swete thynge”,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">becomes “this heavenly Phillis, whose beauty was so
excellent that Helen the pride of all Greece might seem as
a Black a Moor to her”.</p>

<p>Many striking situations and dramatic incidents of the
older stories are lost in the chap-books, for want of picture-making
phrases and live speech. A name here and there,
such as Brademond, King of Damascus, would lift a boy
like a magic carpet, and set him down among Saracen
pavilions; bare facts might call up pictures; there was the
ransom of King Jour,—“Twenty tun of gold and three
hundred white steeds”; but the unlettered writer shirked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
most of the details which, in telling the story aloud, he
would express by gestures. The fine fight with the
dragon, in <i>Guy of Warwick</i>, makes but a paragraph in the
chap-book; the monster’s head is off before the fight is
well begun. Not even a “picture of the dragon, thirty
feet in length, worked in a cloth of arras and hung up in
Warwick Castle for an everlasting monument” could make
amends for this.</p>

<p>Yet a child, making his own pictures out of the poor
phrases of these writers, might have in his mind’s eye
something not unlike the images of the old translator:
the boy Bevis on a hillside with his sheep, looking down at
the Castle “that should be his”; the four Knights selling
him to the Saracen merchantmen; or the giant Ascapart
wading out to the ship, with Bevis and Josian and the
horse Arundel tucked under his arm.</p>

<p>These stand in clear outline, and, in the roughest shape,
have suggestions of pathos or incongruity; but they pass
at once into action, which is what a child wants: the
boy comes down from the hill, forces his way into the
castle and attacks the usurper with his shepherd’s crook;
the Saracens carry him overseas, and set him in the way of
adventure; Ascapart proves himself “a mariner good at
need”, hoists sail and brings his master and mistress
safely into harbour.</p>

<p>Laughter is rare in the romances, but this story of
Ascapart has a humour of its own. Bevis, having beaten
the giant, spares his life on condition that he becomes his
servant; and in the course of their adventures the vanquished
rescues the victor, the servant picks up his master
and carries him about like a toy. Such a feat measures
the great creature more effectually than the exact method
of the chap-book writer: “thirty Foot high and a Foot
between his eyebrows”.</p>

<p>Another “famous History” which came with these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
into the chap-books, was that of <i>Valentine and Orson</i>, first
printed by Wynkyn de Worde, and reprinted at the close
of the nineteenth century as an “old fairy tale”. It has
some novel features besides the usual stage properties of
romance. Of the twin brothers separated in childhood,
one is brought up at Court and trained in knightly exercises;
the other carried off by a bear and nourished with
her cubs. This is a foretaste of <i>The Jungle Book</i>:</p>

<p>“In a cave, the bear had four young ones, among whom
she laid the child to be devoured, yet all the while the
young bears did it no harm; but with their rough paws
stroked it softly. The old bear, perceiving they did not
devour it, showed a bearish kind of favour towards it,
inasmuch that she kept it and gave it suck among her
young ones for the space of one year”.</p>

<p>The second chapter records how the bear’s nursling,
Orson, grew up into a Wild Man, and how the young
knight Valentine, his brother, meeting him in a wood, won
a victory of skill against strength; after which, still
unconscious of their relationship, he tamed the Wild Man
and taught him the arts of chivalry.</p>

<p>The more magical elements of the story have a flavour
of the East, and doubtless belong to the older strata of
Eastern romance. The adventure of the Dwarf Pacolet
suggests the tale of the “Magic Horse” in the <i>Thousand
and One Nights</i>; for by his art this dwarf, who was an
Enchanter, “had contrived a horse of wood, and in the
forehead a fixed pin, by turning of which he could convey
himself to the farthest part of the world”.</p>

<p>Many such marvels, related during the Middle Ages by
merchants or Crusaders returning from the East, had been
caught up in the weavings of romance; but it is a sort of
magic that has little to do with the myth-making power of
childhood. Pacolet’s flying horse is made of wood; the
touch of its hoof never brought water from a mountain-side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
It represents the magic of ingenuity which comes
half-way between pure romance and the practical marvels
of a scientific age.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is but a step from the flying horse of Eastern
tales to Roger Bacon’s horseless chariots and flying
“instruments”. The “Learned Friar”, a clerk of Oxford
in the thirteenth century, foretold many things to be
performed by “Art and Nature”, wherein should be “nothing
magical”. Yet he studied such strange matters that
he was persecuted for practising magic, and the chap-books
set him down a conjurer. The Enchanted Head of Brass
which in <i>Valentine and Orson</i> reveals the parentage
of the brothers, reappears in the <i>Famous History of
Friar Bacon</i>, as the Brazen Head, wrought in so many
sleepless nights by the Friar and his brother-in-magic,
Friar Bungay.</p>

<p>Greene, in his play of <i>Fryer Bacon and Fryer Boungay</i>
(1591), follows this well known tract,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which came down
with few changes to the eighteenth century. Here the old
magic machinery goes with the light movement of a
popular tale. The Brazen Head should have disclosed a
secret whereby Friar Bacon “would have walled England
about with brass”; but the stupidity of his servant
Miles prevented it. For when the two magicians, worn
out with toil, lay down to sleep, they set him to watch
the Head, commanding him to call them the moment it
should speak; and he, the while, kept up his spirits “with
tabor and pipe and song”.</p>

<p>When at last the Head spake these words: “Time
Is,” and no more, Miles, understanding nothing by that,
fell to mockery: “If thou canst speak no wiser, they
shall sleep till doomsday for me. Time is! I know Time
is, that you shall hear, Goodman Brazen Face!”</p>

<p>So saying, he fitted the words to the tune of “Dainty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
come thou to me”, and sang for half-an-hour. Thereupon
the Head spake again, saying two words and no
more: “Time Was”; whereat the Simpleton railed
afresh, and another half-hour went by.</p>

<p>Then the Brazen Head spake again, these words:
“Time is Past”, and then fell down; and presently
followed a terrible noise, with strange flashes of fire,
so that Miles was half-dead with fear.</p>

<p>“Out on thee, villain,” cried Friar Bacon, “thou hast
undone us both; hadst thou but called us when it did
speak, all England had been walled about with brass, to its
glory and our eternal fame.”</p>

<p>Locke’s followers were never tired of setting the “plain
Magique of tru Reason’s Light” against Friar Bacon’s
conjurings. There were later moralists who recognized
the Wizard as a pioneer of science; but these would have
none of his magic, and rejected all tales of undeserved
good fortune.</p>

<p>Wordsworth alone had the courage to tum a child loose
in the enchanted woods. He praised <i>The History of
Fortunatus</i>, which is more like “Aladdin” than any tale
of chivalry. By sheer luck the Spendthrift finds a Galley
of Venice lying at anchor and gets his choice of gifts. These
vanished like fairy gold in the hands of his sons, and
children remembered little else but his Wishing Cap and
his Purse that never was empty. Yet Fortunatus was
a name to conjure by, and the pure spirit of adventure
was in his first setting out, as the woodcut shows, “with
a Hawk in his Hand”.</p>

<p>It seems odd that the eighteenth century child should
have ballads about King Arthur and his Knights, but no
account of them in prose. Malory’s “Noble Histories”,
like the once famous cycles of Amadis and the Palmerins,
escaped the chap-book writers; but they had one or two
relics of the old <i>Historyes of Troye</i>, in which Priam’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
palace had become an enchanted castle, and Hector a
knight errant.</p>

<p>The pedlar had no chronology. Patient Grissel, fresh
from a new translation of Boccaccio, was a lady of the
eighteenth century, and what pleased the country fireside
of 1700 still pleased it in 1760. The tales that Mr.
Burchell gave the children in <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>
might have come out of a chapman’s bundle in almost any
part of the century: “the story of the Buck of Beverland,
with the History of Patient Grissel, the Adventures of
Catskin and then Fair Rosamond’s Bower.”</p>

<p>Among other “useless Trumpery” were riddles, nonsense-books
and farcical tales of rogues or simpletons.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
These are full of the topsy-turvy nonsense that children
love, and the coarse jests from which they were seldom
guarded. The older stories, even when they deal with
everyday life, give it a romantic flavour. The Cobbler
feasts with the King; the Valiant London Prentice leaves
his shop on London Bridge, and sets out to joust with
eastern princes. A Tudor pedlar, Tom Long, in the course
of his absurd adventures, visits the Cave of the Seven
Sleepers, whose story makes a welcome interlude:</p>

<p>“Coming to the town, they found everything altered,
the inhabitants being other sort of people than they were
the night before. So, going to buy food, the people refused
to take their money, saying they knew not the coin; but
enquiring further, found that since their being there, three
generations had been dead and the fourth was in being”.</p>

<p>Tom Long was the puppet of a nonsense-book; but
other chap-books, following Deloney, told the “true
histories” of industrious fortune-makers who were not out
of place in a commercial age; and the life of an eighteenth
century pedlar was plain enough to pass for truth.
An account (in a late Stirling tract)<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the “Flying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Stationer”, Peter Duthie, shows that he took up his trade
in 1729, when he was eight years old, and was upon the
road for eighty years—a Georgian Autolycus, known for
his quaint wit “in every city, town, village and hamlet
in great Britain”. At some time, perhaps, he sold “lives”
of his brethren Dougal Graham and John Cheap the
Chapman, whose story was “moralised” by Hannah
More.</p>

<p>The traveller is always a romantic figure. No amount
of fact can take the pleasure of expectation and surprise
out of a journey, and the setting of most chap-books was
a journey by land or sea. The “Flying Stationer” asked
no more for the Wonderful Voyages of Sir John Mandeville
than for the rough yarn of a ship-wrecked sailor.</p>

<p>This last, if it pointed a moral, might serve a double
purpose, for the old allegories were dying out, except in
burlesques. Abstractions always had a way of coming
alive when they set foot on English ground, and <i>The
History of Laurence Lazy</i>, of “Lubberland Castle in the
County of Sloth” was no mere allegory of Idleness, but the
tale of a scapegrace who, to the joy of all children, got the
better of the Schoolmaster, the Squire’s Cook and the
Farmer. His “Arraignment and Trial” in the Town Hall
of “Never Work” was a triumphant apology for idlers;
yet a scene like this may have suggested the symbolic
trial of Christian and Faithful in the Town of Vanity.</p>

<p>That splendid chap-book, <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is
built up of such things. Bunyan’s reading, outside the
Bible (although he counted it among his sins) had
acquainted him with romances, tales of magic and enchantment,
“histories” of live persons; and all these, or
nearly all, were concerned with adventures upon the road.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>Bible stories and Christian legends were common in
Bunyan’s youth. There was a versified “history” of
Joseph and his Brethren, and the beautiful legend of the
Glastonbury Thorn was as well known as that of <i>The Seven
Sleepers</i> or <i>The Wandering Jew</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i> dealt in terms of unmistakable
experience with the journey that every man must go; the
figures of its allegory were live persons, such as a man
might meet upon any road, and its setting changed as the
way ran through towns and villages, past fields and
sloughs and thickets, over hills where the surest-footed
might fall “from running to going and from going to
clambering upon his hands and knees, because of the
steepness of the place”, or beside rivers that ran through
meadows and orchards, with lilies underfoot, and above,
“green trees with all manner of fruit”.</p>

<p>These things give place at certain points, as they do in
life, to the scorched plains of torment, the overwhelming
Shadow of Death, or, where the river and the way for a
time part, to the Dungeon of Despair. There are glimpses
by the way of strange and beautiful lands, of vineyards
and mountains upon which “the sun shineth night and
day”; but here also is the road running through the
midst of the country to a city more splendid than the
cities of romance, for “it was builded of pearls and precious
stones, also the streets thereof were paved with gold”.</p>

<p>The child would start on this journey with some
knowledge of his bearings, for, like Bunyan, he had set
out on an earlier pilgrimage with Guy of Warwick.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
At the Palace Beautiful, he would remember how
Montelion had been armed by nymphs, and at Doubting
Castle, how Bevis had escaped from his prison in Damascus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>No knight ever strove with giant or dragon as Christian
struggled with Apollyon; none of the Seven Champions
had encountered the dangers of this road. Yet these were
adventures that might happen to a man in the midst of
his ordinary business; that much a child might understand
beneath the surface of romance which for him is
the chief matter of the book.</p>

<p>This was the first of three great books which pleased both
men and children in the eighteenth century. The others
are <i>Robinson Crusoe</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and <i>The Travels and Adventures of
Captain Lemuel Gulliver</i>.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Each, in its own kind, is a
<i>Voyage Imaginaire</i> and the unwrought matter of all three
was to be found in chap-books. The tale of the shipwrecked
man had never been told with such apparent
truth as in <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. Readers of the chap-book
history of Drake, who were familiar with accounts of
“Monsters and Monstrous People”, would read this sober
journal as the purest matter of fact; nor was there anything
beyond belief in Gulliver’s adventures, to anyone
who knew the pedlar’s book of <i>Sir John Mandeville</i>. For
here, among greater marvels, was a notable account of
giants and pigmies.</p>

<p>The island setting of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, the figure of
Friday, the footprint in the sand, belong to the world of
romance; so do the giants and dwarfs of <i>Gulliver</i>. Yet
in both books, the things that happen are human and
practical; the setting gives scope for the chief interests of
the century: men and morals and matters of fact. Defoe
pointed his moral, and as an afterthought explained the
Voyage of Robinson Crusoe as an allegory of his life;
Swift used the contrary device of satire. But no child
was ever concerned with an under-sense, where he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
follow every turn of the adventure. A philosopher would
not have discovered Crusoe’s allegory, and a child is more
likely to suspect satire in <i>Reynard the Fox</i> than in <i>Gulliver</i>.</p>

<p>The adventures of Lilliput and Brobdignag are the convincing
“history” of a nation of Tom Thumbs and a
nation of Blunderbores; only a little Gradgrind would
question their truth. A child reading <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>
is himself the Pilgrim; in the adventure of the island
he is the shipwrecked man; and in the Travels, first the
big man upon whose body the little men climb with
ladders, then the little man, paddling his toy boat to amuse
the giants.</p>

<p>These books, like the romances, were for little men as
well as big ones; but their authors renewed the old devices
by a masterly simple style. They made pictures such as
were never found in chap-book prose, and rarely in tales
that had passed into ballad form.</p>

<p class="tb">The eighteenth century pedlar had fewer ballads than
his predecessors; yet those he had, like the songs of
Autolycus, were “for man or woman, of all sizes”.</p>

<p>Ballad tunes, from Shakespeare to Wordsworth, were
“Food for the hungry ears of little ones,” and there is
something in the simple conventions of ballads that suggests
the story-telling of a child. Those printed ballads, “darling
songs of the common People”, which Addison found
upon the walls of eighteenth-century houses, attracted him
by their classic simplicity, but the two he liked the best:
“Chevy Chase” and “The Two Children in the Wood”,
had been the joy of Elizabethan nurseries.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Most of the chap-book stories were sung as ballads.
“The Seven Champions”, “St. George”, “Patient
Grissel” and “The London Prentice” were all in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
<i>Collection of Old Ballads</i> printed in 1723, with “The Noble
Acts of King Arthur” from Malory;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and others were
reprinted in Percy’s <i>Reliques</i> (1765) from a folio manuscript
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The ballad maker, dealing with romances, preferred
short episodes. A tedious story would never go to his
quick measures; but by laying his chief stress on speech
and movement, or adding a refrain, he made a thing quite
unlike the short versions of the chap-books, and gave a
certain dramatic unity to the separate parts.</p>

<p>Thus the incident of “Guy and Colebrande”, in Percy’s
folio, had been chosen from <i>Guy of Warwick</i>, and the ballad
of St. George, in the Collection of 1723, deals only with the
dragon story. Some ballads, it is true, cover a sequence of
adventures. “The Lord of Lorn,”, like <i>Bevis of Southampton</i>,
gives the whole story of a child robbed of his
inheritance: a shepherd boy that should have been a lord;
and the scene changes from Britain to France and back
again; but so much is told in dialogue that the story dances
to its end:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Do thou me off thy sattin doublett</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy shirtband wrought with glistering gold,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">To tend sheepe on a lonelye lee.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the fairy world revealed in “Thomas Rymer”, the
ghostly suggestion of “The Wife of Usher’s Well,” there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
is no trace till the close of the century. The true ballads of
Elfland are more song than story, and rise by suggestion
above the simplicity of fairy tales:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O they rade on and farther on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And they waded rivers abune the knee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they saw neither sun nor moon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But they heard the roaring of the sea.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The breath of enchantment is rare in English ballads.
There is nothing in print before Scott’s <i>Minstrelsy</i> like the
magic of these lines; but Percy reprinted a sixteenth
century ballad, “The Mad-Merry Prankes of Robbin
Goodfellow” which Puck himself might have sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From Oberon in Fairyland</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The King of ghosts and shadows there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mad Robbin I at his command</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Am sent to view the night-sports here.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">What revell rout</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Is kept about</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In every corner where I goe</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">I will oresee</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">And merry be</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And make good sport with ho, ho, ho.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is the triumphant laughter of a child. The “shrewd
and knavish sprite” has neither the delicacy of smaller
fairies nor the courtly dignity of his master. He is the
spirit of childish mischief: greeting night-wanderers “with
counterfeiting voice”, shape-changing, “whirrying” over
hedges and pools, or playing tricks on lads and lasses at
village feasts. “Hobgoblin” or “sweet Puck”, half-child,
half-fairy, he roams the English country,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Through woods, through lakes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Through bogs, through brakes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ore bush and brier”,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and boasts of greater powers.</p>

<p>There is no doubting either voice or words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“More swift than lightning can I flye</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And round about this ayrie welkin soone.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Each thing that’s done belowe the moone”.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There are two more fairy songs in the <i>Reliques</i>: one given
“with some corrections” from a seventeenth century
garland, the other, Bishop Corbet’s “Farewell” to the
fairies. The first contradicts the second, for obeying the
invocation</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come, follow, follow me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You fairy elves that be”,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">a team of little atomies appear, proving that they were
never out of England since Shakespeare wrote, but “unheard
and unespy’d”, were gliding through Puritan key-holes
and spreading their feasts while the Bishop was composing
his lament,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Farewell, rewards and fairies!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet these, like Robin Goodfellow, are spirits of Earth;
they eat more than fairy bread. A mortal surely suggested
the details of their feast, but they dance a fairy measure:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“The grasshopper, gnat and fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Serve for our minstrelsy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Grace said, we dance awhile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And so the time beguile;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if the moon doth hide her head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gloe-worm lights us home to bed.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“On tops of dewie grasse</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Yet in the morning may be seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where we the night before have been.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rhymed nursery tales seldom show the true ballad
quality. The only children’s stories in the Collection of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
1723 are “The Children in the Wood”, and “Sir Richard
Whittington”: the one a true ballad, newly licensed and
approved by Addison; the other (also mentioned in the
<i>Spectator</i>) taking precedence of such rhymes as “Catskin”
and “Tom Thumb” for a popular grafting of the romance
of Fortune upon a stock of historical fact.</p>

<p>Southern ballad-printers favoured the merry or tragic
themes of legend and history,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and if few of their songs had
the trumpet-note of “Chevy Chase”, they lacked neither
freshness nor vigour. Some, like “the Blind Beggar’s
Daughter of Bednall-Green”, gave a fresh turn to Elizabethan
traditions, and made up for indifferent workmanship
by a plentiful force of rhythm. Late nursery poets
could not better this trick of the ballad-maker’s:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It was a blind beggar that long lost his sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had a fair daughter of beauty most bright;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many a gallant brave suitor had she,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For none was so comely as pretty Bessee.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another of these old broadsides, “Johnny Armstrong’s
Last Good Night” appeared among Dryden’s Miscellanies
in 1702, in the Collections of 1723 and 1724, and again in
Evans’s <i>Old Ballads</i> (1777).</p>

<p>“The music of the finest singer is dissonance,” wrote
Goldsmith, “to what I felt when our old dairymaid sung
me into tears with Johnny Armstrong’s last Good Night or
the Cruelty of Barbara Allen.”</p>

<p>These are the true stuff of ballads; but a child cares
most about action, and, asked to choose between them,
would be pretty sure to call for the Border Song.</p>

<p>The story of John Armstrong, which came down to prose
in the chap-books, has points in common with “Robin
Hood”, but John and his “Merry Men” have no touch of
Robin’s careless humour. They fight like the heroes of
Chevy Chase, and ask no quarter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Said John, Fight on, my merry men all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I am a little hurt, but I am not slain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will lay me down for to bleed a while</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then I’le rise and fight with you again.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The pirate song of “Sir Andrew Barton”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> is a sailor’s
variant of this. Lord Howard defies Sir Andrew upon the
high seas much as Erle Percy, in despite of the Douglas,
takes his pleasure in the Scottish woods. There was never
a better fight on shore, and when at last the pirate falls
to an English bowman, he repeats the border cry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Fight on, my men!’ says Sir Andrew Barton,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘I am hurt, but I am not slain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’le lay mee downe and bleed awhile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And then I’le rise and fight again’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sir Andrew stands out from his fellows, though the portrait
is not to be compared with Robin Hood’s; and the king
himself speaks his epitaph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I wo’ld give a hundred pound,’ says King Henrye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The man were alive as he is dead!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another of these narrative ballads, “Adam Bell”,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> has
a forest background that suggests Robin Hood:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Merry it was in grene forest</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Among the leves grene</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where that men walke both East and West</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Wyth bowes and arrowes kene.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The full title, “Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough and William
of Cloudesley”, has a sufficing rhythm, and the story is
good; not unlike a Norse Saga, where they set fire to the
outlaw’s house, and like <i>William Tell</i>, where Cloudesley
splits an apple on his son’s head at six score paces.</p>

<p>But the true Robin Hood ballads take a child into his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
country, and he finds it peopled with his friends. From
the first stanzas of “The Curtall Friar”, he is Robin’s man:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In summer time, when leaves grow green</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And flowers are fresh and gay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Robin Hood and his merry men</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Were disposed to play</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this play-humour, the outlaws themselves are children,
as every child is by nature an outlaw. They know better
than to take life for a serious business. To them, as to a
child, it is one long and absorbing game of make-believe.</p>

<p>Robin, like Fulk Fitz-Warine or Hereward, could play
at any trade—a potter, a beggar, a shepherd, a fisherman.
His band were mostly men who had forsaken some dull craft
for this great game of hiding and hunting and robbery.
In the midst of active enjoyment, they set themselves to
redress the unequal balance of fortune; but they never
doubted their own solid advantages over sheriffs and abbots,—the
people who dwelt in towns and cloisters, and had
forgotten how to play.</p>

<p>Early collectors of the eighteenth century found no
ballads that echoed the sound of the greenwood:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">“notes small</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Byrdis mery syngynge”,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or that made pictures of the deer shadowed in green
leaves; but there were imitations of the older songs, and
the setting was always implied.</p>

<p>After 1765, there must have been children who knew the
prelude to “Guy of Gisborne”, from Percy’s <i>Reliques</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When shaws been sheene and shradds full fayre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And leaves both large and longe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is merrye walking in the fayre forrest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To heare the small birdes songe.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The woodweele sang and wold not cease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sitting upon the spraye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So lowde, he wakened Robin Hood</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the greenwood where he lay.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>A child cares little about landscape for its own sake,
but much for the things which it suggests. Here, the
setting is essential to the game these outlaws are playing;
they are as much a part of it as the deer they chase. The
beauty of the forest and the song of birds lead on to the
adventure; but they are as nothing compared to the
romantic fact that this is a place where any man may
meet with Robin Hood.</p>

<p>In the same way, a child appreciates character as it
affects the course of events. Robin Hood’s men are neither
an army nor a clan; they join his company of their own
free choice, after proof of sportsmanship; and the chief
of them—Little John, Scarlett and Much the miller’s son,
are distinct personalities. The result is a spirit of individual
adventure which gives the stories unusual interest
and variety.</p>

<p>The earliest songs of Robin Hood had grown into a
ballad-epic, “A Lytell Geste of Robyn Hood”,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in which
Robin’s character was proved in talk and incidents, and
further shown by the story-teller’s comments on his courage
and gentleness, his respect for women, his love of the
forest; but gentle attributes failed to impress the writers
of eighteenth century broadsheets. They recall the more
obvious traits by a few epithets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will you tell of a bold outlaw,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A story of gallant brave Robin Hood</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Unto you I will declare.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Taking the rest for granted, they deal directly with
Robin’s combats and escapes, his farcical adventures with
bishops and beggars, his daring rescues; and in these, the
quality that comes uppermost is the roguish humour which
above all distinguishes him from the conventional knight
of chivalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>A single attempt to connect him with the romances—the
late ballad of “Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon”—marks
the difference of kind; for though Robin kills
the prince, and John and Scadlock bag a giant apiece, they
move like live men among shadows.</p>

<p>The children of the eighteenth century did not meet the
outlaws of the “golden world”. They knew the Curtal
Friar and Alan a Dale, and what happened when Robin
Hood</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">“Weary of the Wood-side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And chasing of the fallow deer,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">tried his fortunes at sea. They had two ballads at least
that varied old themes of the <i>Geste</i>, “Robin Hood and
the Bishop” and “The King’s Disguise”. And Little
John was their friend,—not of course, the old Little John
who praised the season in the words of a poet; but “A
jolly brisk blade right fit for the trade”, more like the
scapegrace in a popular “History”.</p>

<p><i>Robin Hood’s Garland</i>, printed in 1749, gave a mere
collection of stories for the sequence of the <i>Geste</i>, and many
chap-books copied it in prose; but a rough cadence is better
than none, and Robin Hood was first praised in a ballad.</p>

<p>The chap-books, indeed, were no more than the dead
leaves of romance; it took the vivid play of a child’s
fancy to revive them; but whatever the ballad-maker
touched,—fairy tale or legend or history,—he made a new
thing of it: a story to sing or tell, but short enough to
be sung or told many times over.</p>

</div>

<p>Fairies were not altogether unknown in the Age of
Reason, though the Royal Society kept no record
of their delicate transactions. The little Betty of
Steele’s paper, who terrified the maids with her accounts of
“Fairies and Sprights”, must have learned them, as
children do, from the “Grasshoppers’ Library”; for the
pedlar had no such tales in print.</p>

<p>They were sometimes told as a mixture of ballad
and fairy tale—a story with snatches of ballad rhyme.
Children guarded them jealously, passing them on word for
word, with none of the slips that a printer would have
made.</p>

<p>Such a tale was “Child Rowland”, first set down by
Jamieson in 1814,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> as an old country tailor told it to him
when he was seven or eight years old. But that old tailor
had heard it in his own childhood, and so, doubtless had
his great-grandfathers in theirs; for this tale of the three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
brothers seeking their lost sister, of her being stolen by the
King of Elfland and kept under a spell, is the same that
Shakespeare quoted in <i>King Lear</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Child Rowland to the dark tower came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His word was still ‘Fie, foh and fum,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I smell the blood of a British man’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A child would remember the giant-formula, though he
forgot every word of that “easy pleasant Book, suited to
his Capacity” which Mr. Locke prescribed for him; he
would remember the whole exquisite story: how the
youngest brother found his sister, and what passed between
them (most of it in rhyme) and how he fought with the Elf-King
and broke the spell.</p>

<p>If Child Rowland had been the only story of its kind,
Mr. Locke had yet to reckon with the fancies that a child
might weave for himself out of common experience: the
moving tree that casts the shadow of a pursuing giant, the
wind that wears an invisible cloak, the enchanter sun who
can pave any road with gold. These baffled all his efforts
to drive fairies out of the nursery.</p>

<p>But printed tales, before Perrault, were few enough:
in prose, the giant killers, “Hickathrift” and “Jack”;
in rhyme, “Catskin” and “Tom Thumb” and “Whittington”.
Like printed ballads, they favoured themes of
action and reality. Catskin, the English Cinderella, did
without a fairy godmother; Tom Thumb, although he
tilted with the knights of the Round Table, never saw
Fairyland till he died, and Whittington’s cat was a mere
mouser, a poor relation of Puss in Boots.</p>

<p>The truth is that a child never asks himself whether a
tale belongs to the dream world or to the world of reality,
because either will serve his turn, and either may be true.
Any setting convinces him if the adventure hold; and a
tale that lost its imaginative colouring in the chap-books
might regain it in a winter night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Between 1690 and 1790, there is little change in “The
Pleasant History of Thomas Hickathrift”,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and not a
trace in print of the “astonishing image” that Coleridge
remembered: the “whole rookery that flew out of the
giant’s beard, scared by the tremendous voice with which
this monster answered the challenge of the heroic Tom
Hickathrift”.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The nearest thing to it (in a chap-book of
1780) is the likening of the giant’s head, when it was off,
to “the root of a mighty Oak.” But this image of the
monstrous beard, a piece of pure myth, if it were not the
addition of some imaginative teller, came down from a time
when childlike men invented it to explain the giant shapes
of trees. A child, recognizing the analogy, feels the same
shock of surprise and pleasure as his forest-dwelling ancestors,
and finds in this play of likeness and contrast, the
source and sustaining interest of all giant tales. For there
never was a giant without dwarfs to measure him, nor a
dwarf that had not his giant; nor indeed is Jack’s fight with
Blunderbore a more engrossing spectacle than Tom Thumb
dancing a Galliard on the Queen’s left hand.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Yet there is little of the fairy about Tom Thumb. He
is a real child, mischievous, even thievish,—taking advantage
of his size to creep into other boys’ cherry-bags and
steal. His one poor trick of magic is to hang pots upon a
sunbeam, his one adventure into romance, a mock-heroic
episode at King Arthur’s court.</p>

<p>When Dr. Johnson “withdrew his attention” from the
great man who bored him and “thought about Tom
Thumb”, the escape was not from dull facts into a world of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
dreams, but from the pedantry of words into a simple
realism.</p>

<p>Given a little creature in a land of giants, Tom’s experiences
are strictly logical. He stands on the edge of a bowl
in which his mother is mixing batter, and falls in. When
his mother goes milking, she ties him to a thistle, and he is
swallowed by a cow. A raven that spies him walking in a
furrow carries him off “even like a grain of corn”.</p>

<p>As for his life at Court, there is example for it, “Tom
being a dwarf”; nor was he the first mischief-maker to
find his way there, nor the first poor man’s son that overcame
his betters. But his method of attack was new;
no champion in the annals of romance had beaten Sir
Launcelot, Sir Tristram and Sir Guy with no other weapon
than a laugh.</p>

<p>At Court, Tom bears himself as to the manner born;
wears the King’s signet for a girdle, creeps nimbly into the
royal button-hole, and finds a place, sooner than most
courtiers, “near his Highness heart”. At home, he is still
the gentle scapegrace beloved of village folk. If he craves
a boon of the King, it is to relieve the wants of his parents:
and the boon,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">“as much of silver coin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As well his arms could hold”,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">amounts to the great sum of <i>threepence</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A heavy burden which did make</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His weary limbs to crack.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a kind of natural magic in all this that a child
can grasp without the help of a magician. Tom Thumb
although he is wingless, can wear a fairy dress: an oak-leaf
hat, a spider-woven shirt, hose and doublet of thistle-down
and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">“shoes made of a mouse’s skin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tann’d most curiously”.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Small creatures that creep among grass-blades seem to
have furnished the rhymer with analogies. Tom’s house is
but half a mile from the court, yet he takes two days and
nights to make the journey; he sleeps in a walnut-shell,
and his parents feast him three days upon a hazel-nut,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“that was sufficient for a month</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For this great man to eat”.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“A few moist April drops” are enough to delay his return,
till his “careful father” takes a “birding trunk” and with
a single blast, blows him back to court.</p>

<p>Last comes the notable account of his death, which tells
how the doctors examined him through “a fine perspective
glass” and found—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“His face no bigger than <i>an ant’s</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which hardly could be seen”.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The rhyme is a dwarf epic, perhaps begun by some child
that had found an ant-hill, or a thistle taller than himself;
carried on, with a phrase here and a picture there from
older tales, by the “careful father”, who set it to the
unequal beat of little feet at his side.</p>

<p>But no child could endure the unhappy end. A second
part and a third (both sorry imitations of the first) brought
the “little knight” back to fresh adventures; and even
the printers of instructive books understood the value of
his name on a title-page.</p>

<p>Catskin,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> long forgotten through the more glorious transformations
of her French sister, could hold Dr. Primrose’s
children with the old theme of disguise and changing fortune.
Five parts in verse gave her whole history: how
she was banished, like Cordelia, by an angry father; how she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
disguised herself in a hood of Catskin, and took service in a
great house; how (following here the very print of the Glass
Slipper) she went to the ball and danced with a Knight;
and how, one day when she forgot her Catskin hood, the
Knight, discovering her “in rich attire”, fell in love with
her and married her.</p>

<p>English folk-tales, compared with others more magical,
are like the toys that a child will make for himself out of
a stick, beside the fine inventions of a conjurer; they appeal
chiefly to practical interests, and leave much to the imagination.
Jack killed Cormoran and Blunderbore and the
giant with two heads before anybody thought of giving him
a cap of knowledge, or shoes of swiftness, or even a magic
sword. These things were the addition of a Second Part.</p>

<p>Indeed, a tale never was so plain that it gathered no
colour in the telling. There was an old story of Whittington
without a Cat,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and how the cat got into the story was
more than the whole Society of Antiquaries could tell,
though it met together in 1771 expressly to discuss the
problem. In our own time, most antiquaries are agreed
that the Cat found its way from Genoa or Persia or Portugal,—no
matter whence,—and that it is a piece of folk-lore
grafted upon authentic biography. Try as they will, they
can get little nearer to the heart of the matter than Mr.
Pepys, when he watched the puppet-show of Whittington
at Southwark Fair, “which was pretty to see”, and
remarked “how that idle thing do work upon people that
see it, and even myself too”.</p>

<p>The very truth underlying the modest fable of the Cat
and the song of Bow Bells, had more power than the Wishing
Hat of Fortunatus, and would have carried more fanciful
embellishments; but it is never safe to lose sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
double paradox of childish imagination—that reality is
romance, romance, reality. If “<i>Cendrillon</i>” had never
been done into English, Catskin or Cap o’ Rushes might
have worn the Glass Slipper and ridden in a Pumpkin
Coach. As it fell out, the little kitchen-maid surpassed
them both,—the girl whose ragged dress was transformed
at a touch into “<i>drap d’or et d’argent, tout charmarez de
pierreries</i>.”</p>

<p>Cinderella’s biographer was no less a person than Charles
Perrault, a member of the French Academy, and a friend
of La Fontaine. He also wrote the famous “histories” of
little Red Riding Hood and the Sleeping Beauty, of Hop o’
my Thumb (a distant kinsman of Tom Thumb), Puss in
Boots, and others who have lived so long in English nurseries
that their French names are forgotten.</p>

<p>In his youth, Perrault had rebelled against the formal
education of his day, and when he was little short of
seventy, he turned from his serious works and produced a
children’s book by which he is still remembered.</p>

<p>Fairy tales, indeed, were already popular in France, but
they had become a part of that fantastic world into which
the Court of Louis XIV had been transformed: a world of
courtly shepherds and shepherdesses, who told “<i>Contes des
fées</i>” (“<i>mitonner</i>”, Madame de Sévigné says they called
it) to prove that they had gone back to the Golden Age.</p>

<p>Perrault knew better than to copy them. He wrote for
a public at once more appreciative and more critical: the
nursery society of which, in the introduction to his rhymed
tales (1695) he wrote: “<i>On les voit dans la tristesse et
dans l’abbattement tant que le héros ou l’héroine du conte
sont dans le malheur, et s’écrie de joie quand le temps de
leur bonheur arrive</i>”.</p>

<p>His knowledge of children alone might have carried him
through, but his choice of a collaborator was an act of
genius. When in 1697, the <i>Contes</i> were collected and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
published,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> it was not to M. Perrault of the Academy that the
“<i>privelège du roy</i>” was granted, but to his ten-years-old
son, Perrault Darmancour. The device of anonymity was
common among the early writers of children’s books, and
some critics have suggested that it was beneath the dignity
of an Academician to acknowledge the authorship of fairy-tales;
but Mlle. L’Héritier, Perrault’s niece, who contributed
one tale to the book, declared, before it was published,
that little Darmancour could write fairy-tales “with much
charm”; and Mr. Andrew Lang, following M. Lacroix,
believed that the boy had a real share in the book. He
detected the actual note of a child’s voice in the dialogue:</p>

<p>“<i>Toc, toc, qui est là? C’est voire fille, le petit chaperon
rouge—qui vous apporte une galette et un petit pot de
beurre que ma mère vous envoye ... tira la chevillette, la
bobinette chera</i>”. But this, after all, is the language of
fairy-tales. Here it is again, when the little princess finds
the old woman spinning: “<i>Que faites-vous là, ma bonne
femme—je file, ma belle enfant.... Ha! que cela est
joli ... comment faites-vous? Donnez-moy que je voye
si j’en ferois bien autant</i>”.</p>

<p>It is the language of fairy-tales; and that, of course, is
child’s talk. But the father’s part is clear in the artistic
handling of the tales, in the addition of “<i>Moralités</i>” after
the manner of Æsop, and in asides of laughter or comment
intended for grown-up ears,—a sly dig at the lawyers
in “<i>Le Maître Chat</i>”, or at women, through the Ogre’s
wife in “<i>Le Petit Poucet</i>”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Some such partnership between youth and age there
must be in all real children’s books; whether it be arranged
between them is another matter. The wise writer will
always take hints from the child, will remember the way
he turns his phrases, the tones of his voice, the things that
interest him; but if he remember his own childhood, it may
serve as well.</p>

<p>These stories are all memories of childhood. As their
more intimate title, “<i>Contes de ma Mère Loye</i>”, suggests,
they were handed down for centuries, gathering new
features by the way, till this boy of Perrault’s had them
from his nurse. But no child could have written them as
Perrault wrote. “Cinderella”—the “story of stories”:
the boy could repeat it word for word; but if he had tried
to set it down, he would have lost the thread at the point
of transformation. Those dramatic strokes of the clock
would have been forgotten in the music of the ball. This
balance, this art of simplicity is the work of a man,—an
academician, the writer who, in a French “Battle of the
Books”, took up the cause of the Moderns against the
Classics, and yet lived in the kindly reasonable humour
that belongs to the Augustan Age.</p>

<p>Perrault’s <i>Contes</i> are essentially romantic; the Sleeping
Beauty gives place only to Persephone,—she and her sleeping
household, shut in by the great hedge of thorns; but every
tale has quaint human touches which puts it precisely at
the right angle to life: the little girl, her basket of goodies,
and the sick grandmother, all things of experience; and
then, with a quick turn of the “World Upside Down”—<i>the
Grandmother that was really a Wolf</i> in bed. A nurse
might have told it well enough; but the artist knew the
true colours, the just economy of lines, and the point where
one could turn from the pictures and listen for talk.</p>

<p>Perrault must have followed every footstep in the tales
with the eager sympathy of the boy at his side. Together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
they hid with Little Thumb under his father’s stool, and
heard the poor parents’ desperate shift to be rid of their
children. They were with the tiny hero when he filled his
pockets full of small white pebbles, and made the trail by
which he and his six brothers found their way home; and
they joined in the hopeless search of the second adventure,
when Little Thumb dropped crumbs instead of pebbles,
and the birds ate them. That brings the story to the very
heart of interest: when the hungry boys, lost in the forest
at nightfall, fancied they heard on every side of them the
howling of wolves coming to eat them up. For then Little
Thumb, the youngest and smallest and cleverest of them
all “climbed up to the top of a tree, to see if he could discover
anything; and having turned his head about on every
side, he saw at last a glimmering light, like that of a candle,
but a long way from the forest.” This is matter of
romance, though there is nothing in it beyond Nature.
But—that “glimmering light” threw its beams from <i>an
Ogre’s window</i>, and there was yet to come the Adventure
of the Seven League Boots: those boots that would fit a
foot of any size, from the Ogre’s to Little Thumb’s; in
which either Perrault <i>père</i> or Perrault <i>fils</i> could go seven
leagues at a step.</p>

<p>No copy remains of the first translation of Perrault’s
tales by Samber (1729),<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> nor of John Newbery’s edition;
but a seventh edition appeared in 1777, under the title
of “Mother Goose’s Tales”, and an eighth in 1780. At
the close of the century, Harris printed another, “Englished
by G. M. Gent”, of which copies are still found.
The book fits a very small hand, and though every trace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
of gold be rubbed off the covers, the Dutch paper pattern
can still be seen through diamond patches of colour. The
frontispiece shows an old woman with her distaff, seated by
the fire, telling stories to a group of children; and there are
quaint woodcuts in the text.</p>

<p>The welcome given in court circles to fairy-tales marked
the beginning, or rather, a special phase of romantic
interest; but this had little to do with children. Such
tales, originally simple, caught the elaborate grace of their
new setting, and borrowing variations from the newly-translated
eastern stories, ran into an endless series in the
<i>Cabinet des Fées</i>. In English they were represented
chiefly by the <i>Contes</i> of Madame la Comtesse D’Aulnoy,
which were translated before Perrault’s.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> These were
common as nursery chap-books in the second half of the
century.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more unlike the simplicity of Perrault.
Madame D’Aulnoy’s stories are rich in embroideries of the
folk-tale themes. She makes something very like a novel
of her “<i>L’Oiseau Bleu</i>”; but the adventures of the
bird-lover are well known in such ballads as “the Earl
of Mar’s Daughter”, and no artifice can hide the traces
of an old “<i>cante-fable</i>”. The wicked step-mother of
all fairy-tales transforms the prince into a bird; but the
spy set to watch the princess at last falls asleep, and then
the princess opens her little window and sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Oiseau bleu, couleur de temps,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Vole à moi, promptement</i>”.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“These,” explains Madame la Comtesse, “are her own
words, which it has been thought best to keep unchanged”.
Elsewhere she is less concerned for her originals. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
“<i>Finette Cendron</i>” (the English “Finetta”) is an odd
mixture of Perrault’s “Cinderella” and “Little Thumb”,
in which both stories are spoilt.</p>

<p>Gold and silver are the meanest ornaments in these
fairy novels; they have much of the glitter of a transformation
scene. When the colours fade, there is only a
confused memory of the setting; but fairies and talking
animals remain. Children are not likely to forget “The
White Cat”, “The Hind in the Wood”, or that lurker
in dark corners of the nursery, “The Yellow Dwarf”.</p>

<p>As the century advanced, grown-up persons from time
to time ventured into the unknown regions of romance;
and it is odd to find that the more thrilling their discoveries
in poetry and fiction, the more determined they were to
hide them from children, or to cloak them with moral
applications.</p>

<p>The rhymed “<i>Moralités</i>” which Perrault added to his
tales were a tactful concession to public opinion. No
moralist ever succeeded in reforming Puss in Boots,
though one, early in the nineteenth century, claimed him
as the ancestor of a <i>Moral Cat</i>. It is clear, however, that
Perrault, left to himself, would have trusted his readers
to find their own morals; for in the dedication to his
<i>Contes</i> he says: “they all contain a very obvious moral,
and one that shows itself more or less according to the
insight of the reader.”</p>

<p>The task of reconciling parents and children upon the
vexed question of the supernatural was achieved by
Madame le Prince de Beaumont, with her educational or
moral fairy-tales.</p>

<p>Allegorical persons often appeared in the court adaptations
with names and images drawn from classical authority.
Mlle. L’Héritier had already foisted into the old folk-tale
of “Diamonds and Toads” a fairy called “<i>Eloquentia
Nativa</i>”; but Madame de Beaumont’s tales were simpler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and more convincing. From the parental point of view
she had undoubted advantages over her predecessors in
the fairy-tale, for, in the words of an editor of the <i>Cabinet
des Fées</i>, she “devoted herself entirely to the education of
children”.</p>

<p>Born in 1711, six years after the death of Madame
D’Aulnoy, she spent a great part of her life in London.
Her <i>Magasin des Enfans</i>, published in 1757,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> properly
belongs to the type of moral miscellany introduced by
Sarah Fielding’s Governess<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; but the schoolroom setting
could not spoil fairy-tales which, however obvious their
moral purposes, had refreshing touches of humour. In
her intercourse with English children, Madame de Beaumont
had somehow acquired a belief in the educational
value of nonsense.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb’s rhyme of “Prince Dorus” is simply an
adaptation of Madame de Beaumont’s “<i>Prince Désir</i>”;
her story of “The Three Wishes” found in so many chap-books,
is a well-known “droll”, and there are playful
touches in her most serious tales.</p>

<p>Yet a child might venture a protest on discovering that
the little white rabbit in “<i>Prince Chéri</i>”, that leaps into
the King’s arms as he rides hunting, is an educational fairy
in disguise; and it is impossible not to sympathise with the
prince who, in spite of a ring that pricks whenever he is
naughty, becomes a scapegrace, and has to undergo a
Circeian transformation ere he is reformed.</p>

<p>Like all successful <i>gouvernantes</i>, Madame de Beaumont
can be severe. Her fairy in “<i>Fatal et Fortune</i>” deserves
a place in Spartan folklore; this is how she answers the
mother who pleads for a son doomed to misfortune:</p>

<p>“<i>Vous ne savez pas ce que vous demandez. S’il n’est
pas malheureux, il sera méchant!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>One at least of Madame de Beaumont’s tales is worthy
of Perrault. “Beauty and the Beast” would decide her
title to nursery fame, if she had written nothing else. In
1740, Madame de Villeneuve had spun out the same theme
at extraordinary length; but the story as children know
it first appeared in the <i>Magasin des Enfans</i>, and it bears
all the marks of a genuine folk-tale.</p>

<p>It was late in the century before the Arabian tales,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
translated from the French of M. Galland in 1708, appeared
in English children’s books. In France, they received a
welcome surpassing that of the fairy-tales, and produced
a fantastic literature of supposed translations, in which
Eastern imagery and the incidents of Western folk-lore
were curiously mixed. Yet the new pattern was not
altogether incongruous. Dwarfs and magicians were the
stock figures of romance; the Quest of the Talking Bird,
Singing Tree and Yellow Water was but a variant of the
Fortune-Seeker’s adventures; the Magic Mirror a
commonplace of fairy-tales; and there were old ballads,
like “The Heir of Linne”, with Arabian, Persian and
Turkish variants.</p>

<p>Eastern stories, nevertheless, had more in common with
Court fairy-tales than with those of natural growth. They
were woven, like oriental carpets, for Kings’ palaces, and
the “Folk” elements were simply repeated as a part of
the design. Children as yet knew nothing of these visions
of splendour and terror, which turned the French Court
from its pose of simplicity, and coloured the whole fabric
of the <i>Cabinet des Fées</i>.</p>

<p>But the British tendency to moralise was never stronger
than in the eighteenth century, and eastern fables and
aphorisms were rich in illustrations of philosophy. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
for the greater part of the century, the English oriental
tale was moralised, and if children came into any part of
their legacy, it was either by courtesy of the moralist, or
through illicit traffic with the pedlar.</p>

<p>Neither Steele nor Johnson mentions these tales among
children’s books; but the “precious treasure” of Wordsworth’s
childhood, a “little yellow canvas-covered book”,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
although it was but “a slender abstract of the Arabian
tales,” was within the reach of other children. Wordsworth
tells how he and another boy hoarded their
savings for many months to buy the “four large volumes”
of “kindred matter”. Failing in resolution, they never
got beyond the smaller book; yet this, if it had only the
tales of the Merchant and the Ginni, the Fisherman, the
Sleeper Awakened and the Magic Horse, would build them
a city of dreams. Whereas it almost certainly contained
the Voyages of Sinbad,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and the two apocryphal tales,
never doubted by children, “Aladdin” and “The Forty
Thieves”.</p>

<p>Such a book was a maker of magicians. The child that
possessed it found himself richer than Ali Baba, for he
knew the magic formula that would open all the treasure-caves
of the East. He was the shipmate of Sinbad, that
sailor of enchanted seas; the fellow of Aladdin, possessing
the ring and lamp that gave him mastery over slaves
“terrible in aspect, vast in stature as the giants”, who
could carry him a thousand leagues while he slept, or build
in a single night a palace “more splendid than imagination
can conceive”.</p>

<p>The tastes of Wordsworth and his schoolfellows were
probably more catholic than those of the little De Quinceys,
who discussed in the nursery the relative merits of the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>, and dared to question the judgment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Mrs. Barbauld, “the queen of all the bluestockings”,
because she preferred “Aladdin” and “Sinbad” to all
the rest.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Most children would agree with her, for even
the cave where they measured gold like grain lacks the
splendour of the garden in which the trees “were all
covered with precious stones instead of fruit, and each
tree was of a different kind, and had different jewels of all
colours, green and white and yellow and red.”</p>

<p>The palace, though all its storeys were of jasper and
alabaster and porphyry and mosaics, was not half so
dazzling as this garden of jewels.</p>

<p>As to “Sinbad”, it may be, as De Quincey judged, “a
mere succession of adventures”; to a child, it is a second
Odyssey. The giant that throws masses of rock at Sinbad’s
raft is a brother of the Cyclops; Proteus is one with the
Old Man of the Sea. But the adventures of Odysseus are
plain and straight compared with the extravagant splendours
of this merchant-adventurer. He walks by a river
of dreams (which is yet a real river) till he finds the tall
vessel that pleases him; but once afloat with black slaves
and pages and bales of merchandise, he cares less for the
occupation of traffic than for “the pleasure of seeing the
countries and islands of the world”.</p>

<p>This is the very desire of the child; nor did dream-islands
ever yield romance in greater profusion. One,
indeed, is no island, but a great fish, on whose back the sand
has been heaped up till trees have grown upon it; no
sooner is the sailors’ fire alight than the solid ground sinks
under their feet. In another, Sinbad descries from the top
of a tree a “white object of enormous size”, the egg of a
Roc, that gigantic bird whose wings obscure the sun.</p>

<p>Sir John Mandeville might have set down the adventures
of the rhinoceros and the elephant, the valley of diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
or the river of jacinths and pearls; but his account could
never compare with this for reality.</p>

<p>These voyages among the islands, from El-Basrah to
Sarandib, though they are set down in the language of
myth, are as easy to trace upon a map as the wanderings of
Odysseus between Troy and Ithaca. Nor is the Eastern
story-teller without a Homeric interest in things seen and
discovered, both great and small: a thousand horsemen
clad in gold and silk, or a letter sent by the King of Sarandib
to Harun Er-Rashid, written “on the skin of the
Khawi, which is finer than parchment”, in writing of
ultramarine.</p>

<p>The quality of realism is indeed one of the distinguishing
features of Eastern romance. Sinbad’s account of the
building of his raft from the planks and ropes of the
wrecked ship almost reads like an entry in Crusoe’s journal,
and there is the characteristic opening which simulates a
narrative of fact: “In the time of the Khalifeh, the Prince
of the Faithful Harun Er-Rashid, in the city of Baghdad”.
All the sounds and colours of the East are in the setting of
these tales, all the details of life and traffic; and yet it is
never out of keeping with the supernatural. Wizards and
fairies simply move among the natural inhabitants of
bazaars or palaces,—a thing in no way surprising to a child;
and forms of enchantment surpassing the illusions of a
dream rise up in existing cities.</p>

<p>In a realistic age, such a setting would atone for the
elements of unreality; yet the authors of the <i>Tatler</i> and
<i>Spectator</i> (those gentle schoolmasters of grown-up children)
held it of less account than the aptness of the stories
to “reflection” and philosophy. For this they could
forgive “that Oriental extravagance which is mixed with
it”; but the more philosophical the tale, the less it needed
a real background and moving figures. Vague allusions
took the place of description, and incidents were turned to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
illustrate particular virtues or to point the arguments
of Mr. Locke. Thus treated, the stories were said to be
“writ after the Eastern manner, but <i>somewhat more
correct</i>.”</p>

<p>Johnson followed the same method, but with more
profound philosophy, in the <i>Rambler</i>; and it was in this
“moralised” form that Eastern tales came, straight from
the pages of the <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Rambler</i>, into the first
books which John Newbery devised “for the Amusement
and Instruction” of children.</p>

<p>Thus the story of Alnascar, the Persian Glassman,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
is printed in the last section (“Letters, Poems, Tales and
Fables”) of <i>A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies</i>:
or, <i>a Private Tutor for little Masters and Misses</i> (1763); and
the <i>Twelfth Day Gift</i> (1767) has Johnson’s tale of Obidah
and the Hermit,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> here called “The Progress of Life”.</p>

<p>Nor was there any attempt to choose the lighter and
more entertaining stories for children. Such a tale, for
example, as Will Honeycomb’s of Pug’s adventures
(<i>Spectator</i>, 343), which Addison borrowed from the <i>Chinese
Tales</i>, never found its way into the early children’s
miscellanies, though Mrs. Barbauld, at the close of the
century, produced a somewhat similar series of adventures
in <i>Evenings at Home</i>.</p>

<p>In France, as in England, there were Eastern tales which
came half way between the romance of pure adventure and
the “Moral Tale”. Marmontel chose an Eastern setting
for two of his stories; but English writers for children not
unnaturally preferred Johnson’s “oriental” examples of
conduct and duty, and were willing to sacrifice interest to
moral significance.</p>

<p>Johnson himself would have advised them better.
“Babies do not want to hear about babies,” he told Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Thrale; “they like to be told of giants and castles, and of
somewhat which can stretch and stimulate their little
minds.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>He expressly warned her against the nursery editions
which contained, as a substitute for genuine romance, his
own moralised “Eastern tales”. But the Great Cham’s
remarks upon children’s books were not published with
his works, and parents went on buying the books which he
declared that children never read.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan’s <i>Nourjahad</i> (1767) appeared as a
nursery chap-book in 1808, and Miss Edgeworth, in
her tale of “Murad the Unlucky” (one of the <i>Popular
Tales</i>), gives similar contrasted examples of wisdom and
folly.</p>

<p>Minor moralists were unnumbered. Mr. Cooper, the
author of <i>Blossoms of Morality</i>, having by his own account
“accidentally met with a French edition of the Arabian
Nights during a trip on the Continent”, and being “induced
to wade through it, having no other book at hand”,
was so far moved by the entertainment as to select and
adapt some of the tales “for Youth”, under the title of
<i>The Oriental Moralist</i>.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>A remark at the close of “Prince Agib and the Adamantine
Mountain” gives a fair example of his treatment:
“It may not be amiss to remind my youthful readers that
an unwarrantable curiosity, and a degree of obstinacy
too natural to young people, were the causes of the third
Calender losing his eye”.</p>

<p>The author of <i>The Governess</i>; or, <i>Evening Amusements at
a Boarding School</i>, though she allows Persian stories,
admits that whenever she found “a sentiment that would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
answer her purpose”, she did not hesitate to “make it
breathe from the lips of the Eastern Sage”.</p>

<p><i>The Grateful Turk</i>, one of Thomas Day’s moral tales,
appeared in the same year as Mrs. Pilkington’s <i>Asiatic
Princess</i>, and Miss Porter followed with <i>The Two Princes of
Persia</i>, “adapted to youth”. Alluring titles, such as
“The Ruby Heart” and “The Enchanted Mirror” were
another means of recommending improving histories.</p>

<p>Yet the oriental tale suffered less than native romance
and folk-lore, by this sort of adaptation. Perhaps the
Jinn, being “the slaves of him who held the lamp”, or
“of him on whose hand was the ring”, were more helpless
than other spirits in the power of the Moralist.</p>

<p>English fairies were not so submissive; indeed they
played strange tricks with the little didactic works that
bore their names.</p>

<p>Already (in 1746) Tom Thumb had turned pedagogue
and published his “Travels”,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> a barefaced introduction
to Topography. <i>Tom Thumb’s Folio</i> (1768) was followed
in 1780 by <i>Tom Thumb’s Exhibition</i>, “being an account
of many valuable and surprising curiosities which he had
collected in the course of his travels, for the instruction
and amusement of the British Youths”.</p>

<p>This is somewhat more entertaining than the “Travels”,
having an odd humour of its own; but the Tom Thumb
of the Exhibition has changed his fairy dress for a schoolmaster’s
gown, and lies in wait for pupils “in a large
commodious room at Mr. Lovegood’s, number 3 in Wiseman’s
Buildings, at the upper end of Education Road”.</p>

<p>Here he examines, under the lens of an “Intellectual
Perspective Glass”, the unreasonable things which please a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
child. For example, unripe apples or gooseberries thus
scrutinized, “instantly appear to be changed into a swarm
of worms and other devouring reptiles”.</p>

<p>From this it is tempting to infer that the same merciless
glass had discovered, instead of the traditional wren or
robin, that “little feathered songster called the <i>Advice
Bird</i>” which a child might see at the Exhibition. Such a
lens, focussed upon Whittington’s Cat, would doubtless
prove it a figment, or applied to a magic sword, might
instantly change it to a piece of rusty iron.</p>

<p>Old ballads suffered the same transforming process.
Robin Goodfellow,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> dragged from his haunts to show “a
virtuous little mortal” the way to Fairyland, took on the
likeness of a Philosopher, the better to fool his victims.</p>

<p>Fairyland, he asserts, is “neither a continent nor an
island, and yet it is both or either. It exists in the air,
at a distance of about five feet and a half or six feet at
most from the surface of the Earth”.</p>

<p>The solution of this pleasing riddle is found in a diagram
of the human frame, whereon the Fairyland of Philosophy
is shown to exist nowhere but in a man’s head, hard by
those notable tracts, the “Land of Courage” and the
“Land of Dumplins”.</p>

<p>A knavish sprite, this, who can find matter for jests
in a fairy revolution; for by his account, “the reigning
Monarch Fancy, and Whim, his royal Consort” have
usurped the throne of Oberon; and Imagination is their
eldest son.</p>

<p>In such an age, the boldest outlaw would have much
ado to rescue Robin Hood; and since Robin could point
but a one-sided moral, the writer of little books forgot his
virtues and published his “Life” as a “Warning-piece”.
He, forsooth, “did not know how to work”, had “neglected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
to learn a trade”, and being justly outlawed,
skulked with his “gang” in Sherwood Forest, living
“<i>what they called</i> a merry life”.</p>

<p><i>The Two Children in the Wood</i> afforded ampler scope for
moral contrasts. Addison’s praise had included even the
pretty fiction of the robins, on the authority of Horace
and his doves; but the makers of toy-books were not
satisfied with this. They expunged the robins and prepared
two prose versions of the ballad, one expanding the
story into a novel of domestic life, and the other marring
it with a happy ending.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The novel, an amusing medley, deals in an underplot
with the adventures of the wicked Uncle at sea, laying bare
a past about which the ballad was silent; the rest is
concerned with the home life of the two children, and
contains a chapter of stories told for their benefit. At the
end (by way of reparation, perhaps) the ballad itself is
printed. The novelist carries enough moral ballast to
float it all, and anticipates its effect in rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The tender Tale must surely please.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If told with sympathetic ease;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Read, then, the Children in the Wood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And you’ll be virtuous and good.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But of all these “restorations”, none was a greater
outrage than the attempt of a nursery moralist to rebuild
the Enchanted Castle of Romance.</p>

<p>“The History of the Enchanted Castle; or, The Prettiest
Book for Children” appeared in Francis Newbery’s list in
1777, and was reprinted for Harris early in the nineteenth
century. On the title page it is further described as “the
Enchanted Castle, situated in one of the Fortunate Isles
and governed by the <i>Giant Instruction</i>. Written for the Entertainment
of little Masters and Misses by Don Stephano
Bunyano, Under-Secretary to the aforesaid Giant”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>The wheel has come full circle: folk-tales, ballads,
romances, not one of the forms of popular literature has
escaped. Here at last is the giant himself surrendering
his stronghold to the moralist, delivering up captives and
stolen, treasure, engaging Secretaries, and parcelling out
the Enchanted Castle into a Picture Gallery, Museum and
Library.</p>

<p>The parallel between the Giant Instruction and Giant
Despair is sufficiently obvious; but the giant’s under-secretary,
with official sagacity, turns it to account. He
boldly proclaims himself “a distant relation of the famous
John Bunyan, the pious and admired author of the
<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>”, and proceeds to explain the symbolic
pictures and curiosities in the Castle, after the manner of
Mr. Interpreter.</p>

<p>Yet there is one rare thing among the oddities of this
little book; a statement of aim which involves direct
criticism of existing children’s books. This betrays the
Giant’s intention to make children “as capable of thinking
and understanding what is what (according to their years)
as their Papas and Mammas, or as the greatest Philosophers
and Divines in the whole Country”.</p>

<p>To this end it is forbidden to present even “very little
Masters and Misses” with “idle nonsensical stories” and
“silly unmeaning rhymes”.</p>

<p>It is little wonder that Wordsworth, remembering</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“A race of real children; not too wise,</div>

<p class="noindent">denounced moralist and pedagogue, and cried in vain for
the old nursery tales:</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LILLIPUTIAN LIBRARY</span></h2>

<p>Locke and the baby Spectator—Gulliver in the nursery—The
children’s bookseller—<i>A Little Pretty Pocket Book</i>, <i>The Circle of
the Sciences</i> and <i>The Philosophy of Tops and Balls</i>—Mr. Newbery’s
shop in St. Paul’s Churchyard—<i>The Lilliputian Magazine</i>—“The
History of Mr. Thomas Trip”—Nursery “Richardsons”—<i>Mother
Goose’s Melody</i>—“A very great Writer of very little Books”—<i>The

Juvenile Biographer</i>—Lilliputian Letters—A hint of revolution—The
new <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i>—A farthing sugar-paper series—Lilliputian
books in the provinces.</p>

</div>

<p>For every parent that read Locke’s <i>Thoughts</i>, a
hundred took his ideas at second hand from <i>The
Spectator</i>. Many, indeed, seem to have confused
his notion of childhood with the description of the baby
Addison, who threw away his rattle before he was two
months old, and would not make use of his coral until they
had taken away the bells from it.</p>

<p>It was no new thing to regard a child as a small man
or woman. Since Shakespeare’s time, children had
followed the fashions of their elders. But the tastes of
grown-up Elizabethans were not so different from those
of children. Never, until the eighteenth century, had a
child been taught to think and act like a man of middle
age. The little Georgian walked gravely where his for-bears
danced, and was expected to read dwarf essays,
extracts from Addison and Pope, and little novels after
Richardson.</p>

<p>Swift’s engrossing pictures of Lilliput had no sooner
captured the nursery than grown-up persons began to fancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
themselves in the part of Gulliver stooping to instruct a
little nation; and the logical outcome of this was a “Lilliputian
Library”.</p>

<p>The ingenious artist of an older generation, who could
put “all th’ Iliads in a Nut” must have passed on his
secret to the makers of toy-books; and of these the first
and greatest was John Newbery, a descendant of the very
Newbery who, in the sixteenth century, had published the
rhyme of the “great Marchaunt Man”.</p>

<p>There is no better portrait of John Newbery than the
one drawn by Goldsmith in <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>.
That “good-natured man” with his “red pimpled face”
who befriended Dr. Primrose when he lay sick at a
roadside inn, was “no other than the philanthropic
bookseller of St. Paul’s Churchyard, who has written
so many little books for children”.</p>

<p>Goldsmith was writing for Newbery between 1762 and
1767, and on more than one occasion he, like his Vicar,
“borrowed a few pieces” from the kindly publisher.
He could not have chosen a more graceful way of thanking
him, nor one more likely to give him pleasure, than by thus
imitating Mr. Newbery’s own method of internal advertisement,
associating him with those “little books for
children”, and adding that “he called himself their friend,
but he was the friend of all mankind”.</p>

<p>The rest of the passage recalls Dr. Johnson’s caricature
of Newbery as “Jack Whirler,” in <i>The Idler</i>:</p>

<p>“Overwhelmed as he is with business, his chief desire
is to have still more. Every new proposal takes possession
of his thoughts; he soon balances probabilities, engages in
the project, brings it almost to completion and then forsakes
it for another.”</p>

<p>But Goldsmith again lays stress on his pet project:</p>

<p>“He was no sooner alighted but he was in haste to be
gone; for he was ever on business of the utmost importance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
and was at that time actually compiling materials
for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip.”</p>

<p>An account of John Newbery’s career would itself furnish
matter for a children’s book. He was a very Whittington
of booksellers—a farmer’s son who made his way in the
world “by his talents and industry and a great love of
books”. Every day of his life was an adventure, and he
never lost his Pepysian interest in men and things. Goldsmith’s
story of the inn (or its counterpart) might almost
have come out of the pocket-book in which Mr. Newbery
kept a record of his journey through England in 1740, with
notes of his various “projects” and purchases.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>It was at Reading, where he had begun his trade of
printer and publisher, that he produced his first children’s
book: <i>Spiritual Songs for Children</i>, by one of the many
imitators of Dr. Watts;<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> but the genuine “Newberys”
appeared after he settled in London, first at the Bible and
Crown, without Temple Bar, and afterwards at the famous
little shop in St. Paul’s Churchyard.</p>

<p>He began with miscellanies—quaint imitations of the
periodicals, announced by whimsical “advertisements”,
and professing the aims and methods of John Locke: <i>A
Little Pretty Pocket Book</i> (1744),<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and <i>The Lilliputian
Magazine</i>, advertised in the <i>General Evening Post</i>, March 4,
1751.</p>

<p>Two quotations in the <i>Pocket Book</i> suggest a connection
between two prevailing interests of the day, Education and
Landscape-gardening. The first is from Dryden:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Children, like tender Osiers, take the Bow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as they first are fashioned always grow”;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">the second from Pope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Just as the Twig is bent the Tree’s inclined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis Education forms the vulgar Mind”.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the prefatory letter addressed “To all Parents,
Guardians, Governesses, etc.”, illustrates the difference
between the “fashioning” of trees and children. It is
all pure Locke:</p>

<p>“Would you have a virtuous Son, instil into him the
Principles of Morality early.... Would you have a
wise Son, teach him to reason early. Let him read and
make him understand what he reads. No Sentence should
be passed over without a strict Examination of the Truth of
it.... Subdue your children’s Passions, curb their Temper
and make them subservient to the Rules of Reason; and
this is not to be done by Chiding, Whipping or severe Treatment,
but by Reasoning and mild Discipline.”</p>

<p>So much for the Parents who bought the <i>Pretty Pocket
Book</i>. The rest is a judicious mixture of Amusement and
Instruction for its readers. There are alphabets big and
little, “select Proverbs for the use of children”, <i>Moralités</i>
in plenty; but by the precise authority of Mr. Locke, there
are also pictures of sorts, songs and games and rhymed
fables. There is even a germ of the “Moral Tale” in
accounts of good children, set down somewhat in the
manner of seventeenth century “Characters”.</p>

<p>Between this and <i>The Lilliputian Magazine</i> came an
instructive “Snuff-box” series: The <i>Circle of the Sciences</i>,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
described in the Advertisement as “a compendious library,
whereby each Branch of Polite Learning is rendered
extremely easy and instructive”. But the Newbery
Pedant is never quite serious. When, later, he sets himself
to adapt the Newtonian System “to the Capacities of
young Gentlemen and Ladies”, he does it in a <i>Philosophy</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
of <i>Tops and Balls</i>,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and seems immensely diverted by this
notion of making the Giant Instruction stoop to play.</p>

<p>In 1745 John Newbery left the Bible and Crown, and set
up at the Bible and Sun, near the Chapter House in St.
Paul’s Churchyard. By this time he had become “a
merchant in medicines as well as books” and had acquired
a partnership in the sale of the famous fever powders of his
friend Dr. James, which he advertised with other remedies
in his nursery books, often working them into the story.</p>

<p>Like all really busy people, he could always find time for
a new enterprise; but the “little books” were no mere
relaxation from serious work. His son says that at this
time he was “in the full employment of his talents in writing
and publishing books of amusement and instruction
for children”, and adds that “the call for them was
immense, an edition of many thousands being sometimes
exhausted during the Christmas holidays”.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>This, in fact, was a favourite “project” of Mr.
Newbery’s, never forsaken for another, but continued up
to the time of his death.</p>

<p>One can imagine him, delighted as Mr. Pepys with his
puppet show,—inspecting the woodcuts, examining different
patterns of Dutch flowered paper for the binding, deciding
the exact size (4 inches by 2¾) for the biography of
Mr. Trip; or watching the young apprentices (these paper
covers were painted by children) each filling a row of diamond
spaces with his appointed colour.</p>

<p>His next venture was <i>The Lilliputian Magazine</i><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
announced as “an attempt to amend the World, to render
the Society of Man more amiable, and to re-establish the
Simplicity, Virtue and Wisdom of the Golden Age”.</p>

<p>Details of the proposed method are set forth in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
following “Dialogue” between a gentleman and the
Author:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Gentleman</i>:</td>
    <td class="noindent">I have seen, Sir, an Advertisement in the Papers of the Lilliputian
    Magazine to be published at Three Pence a Month: pray, what is the Design
    of it?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Author</i>:</td>
    <td class="noindent">Why, Sir, it is intended for the Use of Children, as you may perceive
    by the Advertisement, and my Design is, by Way of <i>History</i> and
    <i>Fable</i>, to sow in their Minds the Seeds of Polite Literature and
    to teach them the great Grammer (<i>sic</i>) of the Universe: I mean the
    Knowledge of Men and Things.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The framework of the book suggests a combination (in
miniature) of the Royal Society and the Spectator Club;
for the various Pieces are submitted to a Society of young
Gentlemen and Ladies (including a young Prince and
several of the young Nobility) presided over by little Master
Meanwell (who by reading a great many Books and observing
everything his Tutor said to him, acquired a great deal
of Wisdom).</p>

<p>The “Histories” and “Fables” that follow are not
mixed from Mr. Locke’s prescription. They are amusing
parodies of Mr. Newbery’s (or his contributor’s) reading
from the <i>Spectator</i> and <i>Gulliver</i> and Richardson’s novels.
Not even Gulliver escapes the moralising tendency, and
Lilliput (here translated to the “Island of Angelica”)
is a new Utopia, where no man is allowed more money than
he needs. The inhabitants are so little removed from
common experience that they appear to be “no more
than a gigantic Sort of Lilliputian, about the size of the
Fairies in Mr. Garrick’s Queen Mab”.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Locke would have scorned the fanciful descriptions of
this <i>Voyage Imaginaire</i>; nor would “A History of the Rise
and Progress of Learning in Lilliput” (which precedes it)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
have pleased him better; he never could have understood
the sly humour of its author.</p>

<p>Indeed, but for the date, there might be some truth in
the suggestion that Goldsmith edited <i>The Lilliputian
Magazine</i>. For among its contributions was that notable
“History of Mr. Thomas Trip” in which his philanthropic
bookseller was engaged; and in the “History”, a rhyme
of “Three Children Sliding on the Ice”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> that Goldsmith
might well have invented to temper the virtues of Mr. Trip;
for indeed, this hero, though he scarcely overtops Tom
Thumb, is the Wyse Chylde in little: “whenever you see
him, you will always find a book in his hand”.</p>

<p>But Goldsmith was not yet in London when <i>The Lilliputian
Magazine</i> appeared; the rhyme of “Three Children”
is now said to be John Gay’s; and it was Goldsmith himself
who named John Newbery as Tommy Trip’s biographer.</p>

<p>The other contributions are mere attempts to fit children
of middle age with little novels of morality and sentiment,—surely
not the least flattering imitations of Richardson.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>First comes the “History of Florella, sent by an unknown
Hand (and may, for aught we know, have been published
before)”, and after an interval for further reference and
collation, “The History of Miss Sally Silence, communicated
by Lady Betty Lively”. But neither the story nor
the sentiment rings true. As yet, the Lilliputian novel has
no life: and all that there is to be said of Miss Sally is
condensed in her epitaph:</p>

<p class="center">“Here lie the Remains of the Duchess of Downright:<br />
Who, when a Maid, was no other<br />
than Sarah Jones<br />
A poor Farmer’s Daughter.<br />
From her Attachment to Goodness she<br />
became great.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>Her Virtue raised her from a mean State<br />
To a high Degree of Honour<br />
and<br />
Her Innocence procured her Peace in her last Moments.<br />
She smiled even in Agony<br />
And embraced Death as a friendly Pilot<br />
Who was to steer her<br />
To a more exalted State of Bliss.”</p>

<p>Here the author, as if doubting his effect, adds a direct
appeal:</p>

<p class="center">“Little Reader,<br />
Whoever thou art, observe these her Rules<br />
And become thyself<br />
A Copy of this bright Example.”</p>

<p>It was somewhere between 1760 and 1765, when a latent
spirit of romance was beginning to move the grown-up
world, that the children’s bookseller turned his attention
to Nursery Rhymes.</p>

<p>Some of these were already in print. <i>Tommy Thumb’s
Pretty Song Book</i><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> had appeared in 1744: two tiny volumes
in Dutch flowered boards, of which the second only has
survived. This was a great advance on the song-books
commonly given to children as soon as they could read;
but there is something more than the usual nonsense and
rhythm in the Newbery rhymes. The very title: <i>Mother
Goose’s Melody</i>,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> brings them into touch with the first book
of fairy-tales; and indeed those two voices (the child’s and
the man’s) can be heard here as in Perrault—a merry new
partnership of song and laughter—, the one piping high in
lively see-saw, the other declaiming a mock-learned “Preface”,
fitting each rhyme with an ironic “Note” or
“Maxim”, burlesquing the commentators and setting
the wit of nursery sages against the wisdom of the pedants.</p>

<p>The editor of <i>Mother Goose’s Melody</i>, although the Preface
declares him “<i>a very great Writer</i> of very little Books”,
has none of that contempt for “Nonsense” which philosophers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
are apt to show. He traces “the Custom of making
Nonsense Verses in our Schools” to “the Old British
Nurses, the first Preceptors of Youth”, and speaks of them
with evident respect. Yet he shows no bias towards the
more imaginative absurdities. It is the use of a rhyme for
ironic comment, or its lyric quality that directs his choice.</p>

<p>The song about Betty Winckle’s Pig that lived in clover
(“but now he’s dead and that’s all over”) is annotated
thus: “A Dirge is a Song for the Dead; but whether this
was made for Betty Winckle or her Pig is uncertain—no
Notice being taken of it by Cambden or any of the famous
Antiquarians”.</p>

<p>This is “Amphion’s Song of Eurydice”:</p>

<p class="noindent">And this the comment (in small type, for Parents):
“Those Arts are the most valuable which are of the greatest
Use”.</p>

<p>Such gentle irony would be lost upon the serious student
of Lilliputian Ethics. Grown-up wiseacres and little philosophers
must have puzzled their heads in vain over some of
these “Maxims” and exclaimed at the effrontery of a
Writer, however “great”, who, after suggesting that an
unmeaning rhyme “might serve as a Chapter of Consequence
in the New Book of Logick”, could add (in a note
upon “Margery Daw”): “It is a mean and scandalous
Practice among Authors to put Notes to Things that
deserve no Notice. (Grotius)”.</p>

<p>There is no direct evidence of Goldsmith’s hand in this;
but he was well acquainted with nonsense-songs, and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Hawkins, writing of her childhood in a letter, connects him
with a nursery-rhyme: “I little thought”, she says, “what
I should have to boast when Goldsmith taught me to play
Jack and Gill by two bits of paper on his fingers.”</p>

<p>If this “very great Writer of very little Books” was not
Goldsmith, it is an extraordinary coincidence that the
rhyme in the Preface should be the same that he sang to
his friends on the first night of <i>The Good Natur’d Man</i>, and
“never consented to sing but on special Occasions”—which
runs thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There was an old Woman tossed in a Blanket,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Seventeen times as high as the moon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But where she was going no mortal could tell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For under her arm she carried a Broom,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And I’ll be with you by and by.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is only one Lilliputian book that has been attributed
to Goldsmith with the consent of his biographer, and
that is Mr. Newbery’s masterpiece, the quaint and original
<i>History of Goody Two-Shoes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Here is the characteristic notice that appeared in <i>The
London Chronicle</i> (December 19-January 1, 1765):</p>

<p>“The Philosophers, Politicians, Necromancers, and the
Learned in every Faculty are desired to observe that on the
1st of January, being New Year’s Day (Oh, that we may all
lead new lives!), Mr. Newbery intends to publish the following
important Volumes, bound and gilt, and hereby invites
all his little Friends who are good to call for them at the
Bible and Sun, in St. Paul’s Churchyard: but those who are
naughty are to have none”.</p>

<p>Here follows a list of the “important Volumes”: “The
Renowned History of Giles Gingerbread: a little Boy who
lived upon Learning;” Easter, Whitsuntide and Valentine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
“Gifts”; “The Fairing”; and after these an announcement
of greater interest, that “there is in the Press and
speedily will be published, either by Subscription or otherwise,
as the Public shall please to determine, The History
of Little Goody Two-shoes, otherwise called Margery Two-Shoes”.</p>

<p>The “Gifts” are so many variants of the Lilliputian
Miscellany,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and as to <i>Giles Gingerbread</i>, there is nothing
about him to attract a child, unless his name should conjure
up a flavour of those gingerbread books sold at Fairs,
which could be eaten when the reading grew tedious. The
story (made to fit a penny chap-book) tells, without digression,
how young Gingerbread learnt to read, that he might
have a fine coach and emulate the success of one Sir Toby
Wilson, who also was a poor man’s son.</p>

<p>But <i>Goody Two-shoes</i>, though it offers a similar prize for
self-help, teaches no such politic morality. Indeed, it shows
what can be done with the babies’ novel, by a writer who
understands children and has a winning gift of humour;
but for all that, it presents in epitome the whole Lilliputian
Library.</p>

<p>The title-page at once proclaims its likeness to those
records of triumphant virtue, the nursery “Richardsons”;
the “Introduction” is a miniature essay on land-reform.
Mr. Welsh, who reprinted <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i> in
1882, found an exact picture of the Deserted Village in the
Parish of Mouldwell, where little Margery’s father suffers
the “wicked Persecutions” of Sir Timothy Gripe and “an
overgrown Farmer called Graspall”.</p>

<p>A passage at the close of the “Introduction” certainly
lends some colour to the idea that it was a half-playful study
of Goldsmith’s, for his serious argument:</p>

<p>“But what, says the Reader, can occasion all this? Do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
you intend this for children, Mr. Newbery? Why, do you
suppose this is written by Mr. Newbery, Sir? This may
come from another Hand. This is not the Book, Sir, mentioned
in the Title, but the Introduction to that Book; and
it is intended, Sir, not for those Sort of Children, but for
Children of six Feet high, of which ... there are many
Millions in the Kingdom”.</p>

<p>The change, after all, is merely from Lilliput to Brobdignag,—a
voyage that represents no more difficulty to the
editor than to Gulliver himself.</p>

<p>It is in Lilliputian pedagogy that the writer of <i>Goody
Two-Shoes</i> has so completely outdistanced his fellows.</p>

<p>For although none of them could produce a more whole-hearted
supporter of Locke’s theories than “little Two-Shoes”,
she wastes no time in abstract reasoning, but puts
them at once into practice.</p>

<p>No sooner did she learn to read (and that was startlingly
soon) than she began to teach her companions, and finding
them by no means so quick nor so diligent as herself, she
cut out of several pieces of wood ten “Setts” of large letters
and ten of small (all printed very clear in the text); “and
every Morning she used to go round to teach the Children
with these Rattletraps in a Basket—<i>as you see in the Print</i>”.</p>

<p>The letter-games of Goody Two-Shoes were doubtless
among the “twenty other Ways” hinted at by Mr. Locke
when he described his own, in which “Children may be
cozen’d into a Knowledge of the Letters”. There are
minute directions for playing them in the chapter that tells
“How little Two-Shoes became a <i>trotting Tutoress</i>”.</p>

<p>Nor is virtue (the philosopher’s chief concern) neglected
for this matter of mere learning. There are lessons and
reflections enough for the old “Schools of Virtue”; but
little Margery’s true piety makes amends for her preaching
and saves her from the prudential excess of the “little
Boy who lived upon Learning”. When she admonished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the sick gentleman for his late hours by the example of the
rooks, she forced him to laugh and admit that she was “a
sensible Hussey”. The Reader (more often admonished)
does the same.</p>

<p>In this blending of morality and humour, the author is
only following the practice of eighteenth century novelists.
His morality (in the main, very sound and reasonable)
hangs by the humour of separate incidents; yet these,
together, form a sequence of moral and “cautionary”
tales. There is, for example, the warning against useless
display in the account of Lady Ducklington’s funeral,—“the
Money they squandered away would have been better
laid out in little Books for Children, or in Meat, Drink and
Cloaths for the Poor”;—against superstition,—the story
of the ghost in the church, or the dramatic Witch story of
the Second Part; and there are parallel examples of kindness
and good sense.</p>

<p>A small child would make his first reading by the woodcuts
(which are much like a child’s drawings): here, first,
are little Margery and her brother, left, like the Children in
the Wood “to the Wide World”; here is Tommy Two-Shoes
(at an incredibly tender age) dressed like a little
sailor—“<i>Pray look at him</i>”,—and there again, wiping off
Margery’s tears with the end of his jacket—“<i>thus</i>”—and
bidding her cry no more, for that he will come to her again
when he returns from sea. He is much blurred in this
picture—perhaps with tears.</p>

<p>At this point the story goes back to the frontispiece: by
far the best picture of Margery, in a setting of trees and
fields, with a little house on one side of her and a church in
the distance. She is wearing her <i>two shoes</i> for the first time
(for until a charitable good man gave her a pair, she had
but one): “stroking down her ragged Apron <i>thus</i>”, and
crying out: “<i>Two Shoes, Mame, see two Shoes</i>”.</p>

<p>Next comes that serious business of Letters and Syllables.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
But Somebody (with a Basket of Rattle-traps) is at the
door.</p>

<p>“Tap, tap, tap, who’s there?” (It might have been
Red Riding-Hood! “<i>Toc, toc! Qui est là?</i>”) But it
is only little Goody Two-Shoes, greeting her new scholar in
the same childish voice.</p>

<p>Thus the little one gets through the lessons and proverbs
of the next few pages, and at Chapter VI, which tells “How
the whole Parish was frighted”, knows the triumph and
delight of reading.</p>

<p>“Babies do not want to hear about babies”, said Dr.
Johnson; but he was never, like Goldsmith, intimate with
the Nursery in all its moods, and it did not occur to him
that his favourite Tom Thumb was but a child seen through
the diminishing-glass of a woodcut.</p>

<p>This, moreover, is a story that <i>grows up</i> in the reading.
At Chapter VI, there is no more baby-talk. These are
mature, even elderly villagers who are so “frighted” at
the idea of a ghost in the church: the argument is between
the Parson, the Clerk and the Clerk’s Wife:</p>

<p>“I go. Sir, says William, why the Ghost would frighten
me out of my Wits.—Mrs. Dobbins too cried, and laying hold
of her Husband said, he should not be eat up by the Ghost.
A Ghost, you Blockheads, says Mr. Long in a Pet, did either
of you ever see a Ghost, or know any Body that did? Yes,
says the Clerk, my Father did once in the Shape of a Windmill,
and it walked all round the Church in a white Sheet,
with Jack Boots on, and had a Gun by its Side instead of a
Sword. A fine Picture of a Ghost truly, says Mr. Long,
give me the Key of the Church, you Monkey; for I tell you
there is no such Thing now, whatever may have been
formerly.—Then taking the Key, he went to the Church,
all the People following him. As soon as he had opened the
Door, what Sort of a Ghost do you think appeared? Why
little <i>Two-shoes</i>, who being weary, had fallen asleep in one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
of the Pews during the Funeral Service, and was shut in all
Night——”.</p>

<p>Such incidents would make even a grown-up reader forget
the Lilliputian context.</p>

<p>Nor is the Second Part (as in other “Histories”) of less
interest, although it presents the dutiful contriving little
Two-shoes as “Principal of a Country College—for instructing
little Gentlemen and Ladies in the Science of A.B.C.”.
A formidable theme, if her inventive genius could not
produce any number of variations upon Mr. Locke’s method
of playing at schools.</p>

<p>A reference to the <i>Spectator</i> at the close of Part I would
make Mistress Two-Shoes a predecessor of Shenstone’s
Schoolmistress; but this is clearly an anachronism. The
village Dame as Shenstone studies her, still sits</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">“disguised in look profound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And eyes her fairy-Throng, and turns her Wheel around”;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whereas Goody Two-Shoes, knowing that “Nature intended
Children should be always in Action”, places her letters
and alphabets all round the school, so that everyone in
turn is obliged to get up to fetch a letter or to spell a word.</p>

<p>Her children have forgotten the hornbook, and with it,
doubtless, “St. George’s high Achievements” which used to
decorate the back. It was Shenstone’s Dame who kept “tway
birchen Sprays” to reclaim her pupils’ wandering attention
from St. George. But Mrs. Margery ruled “by Reasoning
and mild Discipline”, and could dispense with these.</p>

<p>“Her Tenderness extended not only to all Mankind, but
even to all Animals that were not noxious”. Such humanity
alone (notwithstanding the reservation) sets her above
the poet’s heroine, to whose credit he could only place</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One ancient Hen she took Delight to feed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The plodding Pattern of this busy Dame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which ever and anon as she had need</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into her School begirt with Chickens came.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Indeed, Mrs. Margery surpasses Æsop and Tommy Trip
in her manner of pressing Beasts and Birds into the service
of Education.</p>

<p>Locke, whose imagination had stopped short at pictures
of animals, would have detected the insidious workings of
romance in a school where the ushers were birds, where a
dog acted as door-keeper and a pet lamb carried home the
books of the good children in turn.</p>

<p>Yet in another place, the youthful Dame shows herself a
mistress of utilitarian argument:</p>

<p>“Does not the Horse and the Ass carry you and your
burthens? Don’t the Ox plough your Ground, the Cow give
you Milk, the Sheep cloath your Back, the Dog watch your
House, the Goose find you in Quills to write with, the Hen
bring Eggs for your Custards and Puddings, and the Cock
call you up in the Morning——? If so, how can you be so
cruel to them, and abuse God Almighty’s good Creatures?”</p>

<p>Thus the creatures are protected chiefly for their services;
Nature, as yet, is no more than a useful and necessary
background. It is still Humanity that counts.</p>

<p>As to Romance, the writer’s attitude must be judged by
default. There is but one reference to Fortunatus and
Friar Bacon to indicate a preference for works of Reason and
Ingenuity.</p>

<p>This follows one of those quaint interludes that prove
the quick wit and hide the laughter of Mistress Two-Shoes.
In her character of village peacemaker, she contrives a
“Considering Cap”, “almost as large as a Grenadier’s,
but of three equal Sides; on the first of which was written,
I may be wrong; on the second, It is fifty to one but you
are; and on the third, I’ll consider of it. The other Parts
on the out-side, were filled with odd Characters, as unintelligible
as the Writings of the old Egyptians; but within Side
there was a Direction for its Use, of the utmost Consequence;
for it strictly enjoined the Possessor to put on the Cap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
whenever he found his Passions begin to grow turbulent,
and not to deliver a Word whilst it was on, but with great
Coolness and Moderation....
They were bought by Husbands and Wives, who had themselves
frequent Occasion for them, and sometimes
lent them to their Children. They were also purchased
in large Quantities by Masters and Servants; by
young Folks who were intent on Matrimony, by Judges,
Jurymen, and even Physicians and Divines: nay, if we
may believe History, the Legislators of the Land did not
disdain the Use of them; and we are told, that when any
important Debate arose, <i>Cap was the Word</i>, and each House
looked like a grand Synod of Egyptian Priests.”</p>

<p>After this, lest the old spells should work upon some
unguarded child, Friar Bacon is called in, to advertise this
“Charm for the Passions” in a letter of advice:</p>

<p>“What was Fortunatus’ Wishing Cap when compared
to this?... Remember what was said by my Brazen Head,
<i>Time is, Time was, Time is past</i>: now the <i>Time is</i>, therefore
buy the Cap immediately, and make a proper Use of
it, and be happy before the <i>Time is past</i>”.</p>

<p>The Learned Friar has burnt his books, and there is an
end of Magic. Mrs. Margery has no dealings in a “Gothick
Mythology of Elves and Fairies”; her Familiars are the
tame creatures of her household, she does her conjuring by
the legitimate powers of Science. And when, through her
cleverness in contriving a weather-glass to save her neighbours’
hay, she is accused of witchcraft by the people of
other parishes, her advocate, like a true Lilliputian, defends
her with the arguments of Addison and Goldsmith.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>This witch-story is the climax (if such a haphazard little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
plot can have a climax) and it gives a masterly last touch
to the heroine’s portrait.</p>

<p>She is standing with all her pets about her, when Gaffer
Goosecap (full of the weather-glass mystery) comes to spy
upon her:</p>

<p>“This so surprised the Man that he cried out a Witch!
a Witch! upon this she laughing, answered, a Conjurer!
a Conjurer! and so they parted; but it did not end thus,
for a Warrant was issued out against Mrs. Margery, and she
was carried to a Meeting of the Justices, whither all the
Neighbours followed her”.</p>

<p>At the trial her triumph is complete. Even her judges
join in the laughter when she produces the weather-glass
and cries: “If I am a Witch, this is my Charm”.</p>

<p>The writer, whoever he was, had little to learn from
Rousseau. Miss Edgeworth herself could not have
invented a more reasonable and intelligent heroine.</p>

<p>It is easy to see why Charles Lamb put <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i>
among “the old classics of the Nursery”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, and no matter
for wonder that it should be set down to Goldsmith.</p>

<p>For apart from that hint of <i>The Deserted Village</i> in the
“Introduction”, it has living characters, natural speech
and incidents of genuine comedy. The playful tenderness
of the first chapters suggests Goldsmith’s treatment of
children, and the whole theme is near enough to his idea
of a story “like the old one of Whittington <i>were his Cat left
out</i>”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. For if he ever had written such a story and managed
to keep the cat out of it, he would certainly have
repented and introduced some other animal in its place,
or with native inconsistency, might have multiplied it into
a menagerie such as Goody Two-Shoes kept. The idea of
talking animals had once attracted him, and if he could
write a good Fable, why not a “History”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>Forster records Godwin’s “strong persuasion” that
Goldsmith wrote <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i>, and Godwin, himself a
publisher of children’s books, may have had good reason for
his belief; yet there is no certain evidence to confirm it,
nor will the book, as a whole, bear all the claims of its
admirers.</p>

<p>Nichols, in his <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> associates this and
other “Lilliputian Histories” with the brothers Griffiths
and Giles Jones, and family tradition credits Giles with
<i>Goody Two-Shoes</i> as well as <i>Giles Gingerbread</i> and <i>Tommy
Trip</i>; but if, as Goldsmith would have it, Mr. Newbery was
the real author of <i>Tommy Trip</i>, there is no reason why he
should not have had a hand in the rest. <i>Goody Two-Shoes</i>,
in fact, has several turns of speech and grammatical slips
which occur in John Newbery’s journal;<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> nor is it at all
unlikely that Goldsmith, the friend of Giles Jones and
Newbery, contributed such lively matter as the ghost and
witch stories, or so quaint a fancy as the “Considering
Cap”.</p>

<p>John Newbery’s successors<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> carried on the tradition,
but at his death the great period of “Lilliputian Histories”
was past. Their numbers were always increasing, but
they were mostly imitations and moralised echoes of folklore
like <i>Tom Thumb’s Exhibition</i> or <i>The Enchanted Castle</i>.</p>

<p>Yet there are a few late “Lilliputians” that have the
true Newbery touch, and even a fresh spice of satire. <i>The
Lilliputian Masquerade</i>,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> though it goes back to <i>Gulliver</i>,
belongs to the age of the Pantheon and Almack’s, and its
gay “Masks” (all “Lilliputians of Repute”) include two
romantic surprises. For in the company of Sir William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Wise and Sir Francis Featherbrain of Butterfly Hall, there
is the unexpected figure of a Beggar “singing merrily”,
and one undoubted harbinger of the New Age—a little hero
of Blake and of Charles Lamb,—the Chimney Sweeper,
new as yet to the mystery of his “cloth”.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a whole section of the dwarf library was
devoted to the Wyse Chylde in a variety of rôles. Following
that “Rise and Progress of Learning in Lilliput”,
there came a formidable crowd of little Philosophers, little
Statesmen, little Judges, little Divines and (to keep an
accurate record of their careers) little Historians and Biographers.</p>

<p>“Self-Government” in the Schoolroom (by no means, as
some may suppose, a present-day innovation) made its
first appearance in <i>Juvenile Trials</i>,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the acknowledged
device of a Tutor and Governess who prescribe it as a
“Regimen” for their “unruly Pupils”, and thus, profiting
by the wisdom of Cato, induce the authors of great evils to
remove them.</p>

<p>This is the first hint of a Lilliputian Republic: the logical
outcome of Locke’s principles in a revolutionary age.
The Lilliputians give their best support to the new Government
and throw themselves with zest into their parts.</p>

<p>Little Judge Meanwell who, though but twelve years old,
has “all the Appearance of Gravity and Magistracy”, in a
long robe and full-bottomed wig, anticipates parental
criticism by reminding the public that “neither Vanity,
nor Ambition, nor the Desire of governing Others at an
Age in which he stands so much in Need of being governed
himself, has raised him to this Office, which he cannot execute
but with Regret”.</p>

<p>He adds (doubtless after consultation with his Leaders)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
that the Trials, as the result of their “wisest Deliberation”,
are by no means to be treated as “the Sport of Boys and
Girls”.</p>

<p>The Tutor and Governess take full advantage of the
scheme, and after the royal ceremony of inauguration,
leave the unruly ones to the judgment of their peers. Perhaps
it is this unwonted freedom which lets loose a stream
of live and humorous dialogue; for no sooner do the
“Trials” begin than these Lilliputians betray the natural
propensities and dramatic instincts of real children.</p>

<p>Mr. Newbery himself could hardly have drawn better
pictures of country life, or spoken better dialect than the
Farmer in one of these “trials”. In another (which
suggests the ordeal of the Knave of Hearts) the evidence is
not unworthy of Defoe,—the Prosecution putting in a plan
of the kitchen where the stolen plum-cake was baked;
and a third,—the case of Miss Stirling <i>versus</i> Miss Delia,
“for raising Strife and Contention among her Schoolfellows”—is
wholly “conveyed” from Sarah Fielding’s
<i>Governess</i>,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> a source that may explain many unexpected
features in the book.</p>

<p>But the old standards of Authority are restored in <i>The
Juvenile Biographer</i>,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> a collection of “characters” in
moral contrast, with a “Bust of the little Author” as
frontispiece. Some account of him at the end, had it been
prefatory, would have prepared the reader for much of his
philosophy. Throughout the book he speaks plain Prig,—a
development that might be foreseen in one who “when
he came to be breeched, laid aside all juvenile Sports”.
His playfellows think him “a dull heavy little Fellow”,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
he is “a very poor Hand at Marbles, Trap Ball or Cricket,
and little attentive to Play”; when other boys are engaged
in strife, he retires into a corner with some little Book.</p>

<p>No doubt he is a very proper person to record those
juvenile virtues and foibles that might escape a natural
child,—to discern the “Thought, Prudence and admirable
Needlecraft” of Miss Betsey Allgood, to speculate upon the
literary ancestry of Master Francis Bacon, or to deprecate
the failings of that “genteel Child,” Miss Fiddle-Faddle,
who “at seven Years of Age, could spend a whole Forenoon
at her Glass, and devote an Hour to pitching upon the
proper Part of her Face to stick that Patch on”. This
“little Author” is, in fact, a reincarnation of the Baby
Spectator.</p>

<p>There is a year or two between these “Lives” and the
first book of Lilliputian “Letters”. No children’s novel
followed Richardson so closely as to adopt the letter form;
but Locke had expressly advised that children should
write letters “wherein they should not be put upon any
Strains of Wit or Compliment, but taught to express their
own plain easy Sense”, and had further recommended that
when they were perfect in this, they might, “to raise their
Thoughts”, have Voiture’s letters set before them as
models.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The Lilliputian editor, loth to await the child’s readiness
for Voiture, adapted Locke in his own fashion, and devised
new models for the Nursery, which should admit the usual
“Characters” and “Reflections” of the miscellanies, and
at the same time give a suggestion of reality to formal
dialogues.</p>

<p>However full these letters might be of grown-up sentiment,
their very directions and signatures gave proof
(convincing to a child) of the editor’s good faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p><i>The Letters between Master Tommy and Miss Nancy
Goodwill</i>, published by Carnan and Newbery in 1770, was
revised in 1786 with “the Parts not altogether properly
adapted to the Improvement and Entertainment of little
Masters and Misses expunged”.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> What remains, however,
shows no change in style or substance; the Lilliputian
features are intact. As the editor observed:
“The epistolatory Style here adopted is that which little
Masters and Misses should use in their Correspondence
with each other” (not that which they naturally would
fall into) and it is designed “to regulate their Judgments,
to give them an early Taste for true Politeness and inspire
them with a Love of Virtue”.</p>

<p>The “Holiday Amusements” described in the letters
seem to be “regulated” on the same plan (the editor had
obviously forgotten his own); and it is something of a
relief to find Master Tommy (whose relationship to the
Juvenile Biographer is close) warning his sister and her
schoolfellows against the cult of nursery bluestockings.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
He hopes they are “not going to turn Philosophers”; if
they are, he will put them in mind of their needles, their
pins and their thread papers. “Leave these Subjects”
advises this lordly midget, “to us Boys (I was going to
say Men) and we may perhaps now and then condescend
to give you some short Lectures upon those Matters”.</p>

<p>Miss Nancy, schooled in the sisterly virtues, responds
with Persian stories, references to Mr. Addison, quotations
from Pope, and (to clear herself of any suspicion of the
bluestocking heresy) a present of worked ruffles. Upon
this, he, with restored confidence, imparts an allegorical
dream, an instructive story and a “Dissertation on the
Value of Time” which closes on this characteristic note:</p>

<p>“But of all the Diversions of Life, there is none so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
proper to fill up its empty Spaces as the reading useful
and entertaining Authors. For this Reason, my dear
Nancy, you will receive by the next Coach, Mr. Newbery’s
<i>Circle of the Sciences</i>, and such other of his Books as I
apprehend could anyway contribute to your Instruction
and Amusement.”</p>

<p>There is one letter, and one only, in which Master Tommy
forgets his Philosophy and lets the Child in him escape:</p>

<p>“O, my dear Nancy, how shall I tell you that my sweet
Kite which boasted of the two finest glass Eyes perhaps
ever seen, which was so crowded with Stars and which cost
me such immense Labour, is lost.”</p>

<p>The revised edition was doubtless an attempt to keep
pace with the rival firm of John Marshall; for between the
two issues (about 1777) they had printed a new collection
under the title of <i>Juvenile Correspondence</i>,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> which in some
ways was better adapted to Locke’s original plan, as well
as to the theories of Rousseau.</p>

<p>The very fact that these letters are “suited to Children
from four to above ten Years of Age”, and that their
aim is to encourage “a natural Way of Writing”, implies
a change in the general view of education; yet it would
be rash to assume that the writer had more than a passing
acquaintance with Rousseau, or that she (this writer is
almost certainly a woman) drew any clear distinction
between childhood and youth. The whole design of
<i>Juvenile Correspondence</i> is Lilliputian; its aim is expressed
almost in the exact phrase of the Royal Society, and its
origin (apart from the Goodwill “Letters”) can be traced
to a remark of Pope’s (quoted in the book) that he “should
have Pleasure in reading the Thoughts of an Infant, could
it commit them to Writing as they arose in its little Mind”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>Moreover the children who write the letters, instead of
developing on Rousseau’s lines, become more Lilliputian
with each year of growth.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> All the natural touches are
in the letters of the younger ones; from five to seven, they
would pass for living children. Indeed, the first letter
“from Miss Goodchild, a little more than seven Years of
Age to her Brother nearly five” suggests that the next
generation of Lilliputians will refuse to grow up so soon:</p>

<p>“Would you think it? I am sitting in a little Room
full of Books, with a Desk for Reading and my Papers
round me, as if I were a Woman! <i>But I am not so silly
as to forget that I am but a little Girl</i>,</p>

<p class="center">and, my dear Brother,</p>

<p class="right">Your loving Sister, <span class="smcap">Jane Goodchild</span>.”</p>

<p class="noindent">This is the first sign of revolution. The puppets are
still content to play their parts, but they refuse to believe
in them. Instead, they begin to assert their own
“Gothick Mythology”, and are no longer so “subservient
to the Rules of Reason” as to despise the name of Fairies.</p>

<p>Miss Goodchild “could talk all day of the Play” (Mr.
Garrick’s “Fairy Tale” from Shakespeare).<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> She actually
quotes the song beginning: “Come follow, follow me, ye
fairy Elves that be” from an Entertainment “full of
Fairies”, and confesses that she and Jenny were ready to
jump up and join in the chorus, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hand in Hand we’ll dance around</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For this Place is Fairy Ground.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the book is full of contradictions; nothing in it bears
out the promise of those early letters. Master Gentle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
at the age of seven, is delivered into the hands of Mr. Birch
who, as his name forebodes, believes neither in Reasoning
nor mild Discipline; and at ten, Mr. Birch’s pupils become
little monsters of virtue and precocity. They are Lilliputians
of a larger growth, but they certainly are not boys.
This book, moreover, lacks the Newbery touch of comedy.
Its humour is mostly unconscious, as in the account of a
father who asks permission to read his son’s letters, where
the boy confides to a friend that he feels “like the Swain
in Shenstone: ‘<i>fearful, but not averse</i>’”.</p>

<p>Among the numberless books for children printed
between 1780 and 1810, there were three which, although
they discarded the nursery badge of “Flowery and Gilt”,
and had little in common with the Newbery miscellanies,
followed Lilliputian precedent in form and title.</p>

<p>These were the <i>Juvenile Tatler</i> (1783), the <i>Fairy Spectator</i>
(1789) and the <i>Juvenile Spectator</i> (1810).<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The first
two are among the earliest books that show the influence
of Marmontel and Madame de Beaumont; they therefore
are no true Lilliputians: the third mimics Addison’s
method with absolute fidelity, and sparkles with the
satirical spirit of its original; yet this too breaks loose
from Lilliputian convention; it has almost enough sanity
and wit to be called a nursery Jane Austen.</p>

<p>These three will be seen to better advantage with others
of their kind.</p>

<p>A strong revival of romance in children’s books would
have driven out the Lilliputians at the close of the eighteenth
century; but the progress of Theory prevented it,
and produced, with a fresh crop of moral tales, innumerable
reprints.</p>

<p>Canning’s amusing paper in the <i>Eton Microcosm</i> (June 11,
1787),<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> did more than mark the vogue of those tiny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
“16 mo’s” at Mr. Newbery’s and “the Bouncing B,
Shoe Lane”: it was also a tempting advertisement; and
in the early nineteenth century small Londoners who could
not rise to the splendours of “twopence Gilt” might buy
their own New Year and Easter Gifts at Catnach’s or the
“Toy and Marble Warehouse” in Seven Dials, for a half-penny,
or even (with covers of rough blue sugar-paper)
for a farthing.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>In 1779 Saint, the north-country Newbery, had printed
a Newcastle edition of <i>Tommy Trip</i>, and between 1790
and 1812, the entire Lilliputian library was revived in the
York chap-books by Wilson and Spence. Other provincial
booksellers, following these, began to improve
their stocks of school-books and battledores with pirated
“Newberys”; and some, like Rusher of Banbury,
retouched old rhymes and tales with local colour. It was
Rusher who restored the tradition of <i>Giles Gingerbread</i>
with the <i>History of a Banbury Cake</i>;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and in the childhood
of Queen Victoria, his little shop was still famous for toy-books.</p>

Books, Handicrafts, Attitude to Nature and Humanity—The

Bruyère</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Rousseau, even when he repeated Locke’s precepts,
caught the ear of a wider public because
he appealed not so much to reason as to feeling,
and instead of commending his doctrines by argument,
charged them with warmth and eloquence.</p>

<p>Locke had been before him in exposing the shams and
pedantry of schoolmasters, as in striving for a more
natural method of education; but he carried out his task
in a quiet professional way, regarding the child as a
patient in need of a new regimen, but never setting him on a
pedestal.</p>

<p>It was Rousseau’s inspiration to take the beauty and
promise of childhood for his text, to make the child stand
forth as the hope of the race, the centre of all its aspirations,
the proof of its powers.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Thus his philosophy
acquired the dignity of a new faith; and yet the child lost
nothing of his personal and human interest, for in Rousseau’s
scheme, he was the very core of a new conception of
family life. There could be no better setting for a natural
education than the family, no simpler unit of fellowship;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
and Rousseau drew persuasive pictures of the child at
successive stages of his growth,—pictures which writers
of moral tales reproduced with modifications of their own,
and a greater or less amount of theory.</p>

<p>For there was this great difference between Locke and
Rousseau, in their effect on children’s books: that Locke,
beyond encouraging Fables, did no more than furnish a toy
library with his <i>Thoughts</i>; whereas Rousseau taught two
generations of writers to substitute living examples for
maxims.</p>

<p>In making Emile an orphan, Rousseau was guarding
against interference with his experiment; it is no part of
his doctrine that a child should be brought up by any but
his parents, unless they are unable or unwilling to do their
duty. Then, indeed, a Tutor must be found, though he
will never be required, after the manner of tutors, to
instruct. A child needs no other teacher than Experience,
no schoolroom but the open country which is also his playground;
all that the tutor need do is to enter into his
interests and amusements as an equal, and watch over him
while he educates himself. This marks a revolutionary
change in the attitude of the Philosopher to the Child.
Locke’s theory of habit, his practice of reasoning with
children, have no place in the new scheme. Rousseau
would as soon have a child be five feet in height as to have
judgment at the age of ten. Children, he declares, are
incapable of reason, Nature meant them to be children
before they become men. To forget this is to force a fruit
that has neither ripeness nor savour, to produce old
infants and child-philosophers.</p>

<p>Rousseau hits hard and straight at the pedantic mania
for instruction that filled the early miscellanies with
Geography, Chronology and other studies “remote from
man and especially from the child”. Emile must never
be allowed to cheat himself with words. He shall learn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
nothing by heart, not even Fables; for these he is sure to
misinterpret. And how is a child to grow up with any
respect for truth, if his first book teach him that <i>Foxes
speak and speak the same language as Ravens</i>?</p>

<p>With Words and Fables, Rousseau dismisses all the
inventions of primitive imagination that find their natural
place in a child’s mind.</p>

<p>At twelve, Emile hardly knows what a book is. He has
spent his whole life in the country, with a tutor whom he
regards as a playfellow. In climbing among rocks and
trees and leaping over brooks, he has learnt to measure
himself with his surroundings and has lost all sense of
danger. No human will has ever opposed him, and since
it is useless to fight against circumstance, he submits to
necessary evils, and bears pain without complaining.</p>

<p>Emile is stronger and more capable than other children;
yet conscious of his dependence on others, of his need of
protection. Abstract terms, such as duty and obligation,
mean nothing to him, nor will he practise the empty forms
of courtesy; but he has the basis of all good breeding, being
candid and fearless, but neither arrogant nor self-conscious.</p>

<p>From twelve to fifteen, Emile’s education is equally
practical. Curiosity moves him to experiment and
discovery, and thus he learns the simple truths of science
without teaching. Locke’s belief in utility was not
greater than Rousseau’s. The word “useful”, he says,
is the key to the whole situation. Emile is always to test
his discoveries by the question “What is this good for?”
and things which do not satisfy this test are of no account.
The tutor still attends the boy like his shadow, never seeming
to influence the course of events; but since Nature
cannot be trusted to adapt herself to his scheme, he now
finds it necessary to contrive artificial experiences which
Emile accepts as natural.</p>

<p>Rousseau sees nothing inconsistent in this use of artifice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
by which the Child of Nature, though wholly dependent
on the will of his tutor, thinks he is governing himself;
yet everything is so planned and so foreseen that he does
nothing of his own choice.</p>

<p>It is here that Rousseau grudgingly admits the need
of books; but he takes care to restrict his Emile to a single
book which deals chiefly with practical affairs. “What is
this wonderful Book? is it Aristotle? is it Pliny? is it
Buffon? No, it is <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.”</p>

<p>Here at any rate, Rousseau made no mistake. Had
Emile been free to choose, this is precisely the book he
would have chosen, though for less philosophical reasons;
and the very fact that it fits Rousseau’s scheme of education
is a proof that the scheme is sound. Robinson
Crusoe, alone on his island, with neither house nor tools,
gradually providing for his needs; it is Rousseau’s allegory
of the triumph of man, and failure of civilisation. Emile
cannot understand this yet, but the book will be a touchstone
for his taste and judgment, and serve him and his
tutor as a text for all their talk on the natural sciences.
The boy’s interest is wholly practical; but it stimulates
“the <i>real</i> castle-building of that happy age when we know
no other happiness than necessity and freedom”. Of
free and imaginative castle-building, Rousseau has no
notion, but Emile will know his Robinson Crusoe all the
better, if he is allowed to act the story.</p>

<p>“I would have his head turned by it,” says Rousseau,
“and have him always busy about his Castle, his goats
and his plantation.... I would have him imagine he
is Robinson himself.”</p>

<p>It is the reality of drama that appeals to the educator;
the hint was not lost upon writers of children’s books.</p>

<p>And now, since Emile cannot remain always in his
island, it is time to recall him to everyday life. His
natural interest in handicrafts will smooth the transition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
The tutor goes with him from shop to shop, that he may
understand the division of labour among men. Thus he
learns more in an hour than from a whole day’s explanation.
And lest this should be only surface knowledge, he
must learn some trade (for choice a carpenter’s) which will
guard him against common prejudice, and make him
independent of fortune.</p>

<p>Rousseau keeps the road so clear for his young traveller
that he is not afraid of chance encounters. In these years,
Emile is to learn nothing of the relations of man to man.
His heart is not to be touched by suffering nor his imagination
kindled by the “living spectacle of Nature” which
Rousseau himself paints in such glowing colours. Eloquence
and poetry are wasted on a child. Moral and
spiritual teaching can safely be left till his sixteenth year.
Up to that point Emile has studied nothing but the
natural world. He has little knowledge, but what he
has is real and complete. Simple surroundings have taught
him to be content with what he has and to despise luxury,
which, according to Rousseau, is the secret of true happiness.
His body is strong and active, his mind unprejudiced; he
has courage, industry, self-control,—all the virtues proper
to his age.</p>

<p>Rousseau’s disciples had some excuse for disregarding
one of his chief discoveries: the distinction between
childhood and youth. It was obviously impossible to
draw a hard and fast line between the two stages, and
Rousseau would not give an inch to individual difference.
Thus his followers were either forced back upon precedent,
or had to trust to their own experience of children. On
the one hand, they clung to the old encyclopædic methods;
on the other, they transferred Rousseau’s provisions for
youth and manhood to an earlier stage. Experience
taught them that a child could be stirred by other motives
besides prudence and self-love, that moral and spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
influences in early childhood were not to be ignored, that
there were such things as childish imagination and sympathy.</p>

<p>The greater number of moral tales owe their very
existence to Rousseau’s inconsistency; for although he
had exposed the fallacy of maxims and fables, he found no
better substitute than the Example of a perfect Parent or
Tutor—a man without passion or prejudice, detached and
colourless, who, without seeming to guide or correct, should
watch the child’s every movement and on occasion teach
Nature herself how to go about her business.</p>

<p>The first generation of Emile, which proved Rousseau’s
theory of Childhood, disposed, once for all, of the Infallible
Parent in real life. A child might suspect that it was a
literary rather than a practical idea, and the few parents
who, after a vigorous course of self-discipline, felt equal
to the part, would find it easier to sustain by proxy in a
moral tale. They decided, at any rate, to ignore Rousseau’s
veto upon books for children under twelve, and writers
quickly rose to the demand for a new sort of Fables, wherein
the Child of Nature, walking in the shadow of the Perfect
Parent, acquired a measure of wisdom and philanthropy
beyond his years. Such tales, inspired by the Emile, are
a satirical comment on the writing of books to prove that
books are useless.</p>

<p>Marmontel, though he did not write for children, was
an admirable guide for lesser moralists. His vivid
character-contrasts, dramatic incidents and humorous
treatment of every-day life taught them that art might
not be thrown away upon a child’s book, if it only served
to keep alive interest and curiosity. The “Good Mother”
and “Bad Mother” of the <i>Contes Moraux</i><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> supplied useful
variants of the good and bad child, and the “School for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Fathers” encouraged the writers of little books to venture
satirical comments on the faults of parents.</p>

<p>It is true that Marmontel’s types are less convincing
when reduced for the nursery and coloured by Rousseau.
“The School for Fathers” turned out a uniform pattern
of the Infallible Parent, and “The Good Mother”, “<i>La
femme comme il y en a peu</i>”, assuming the proportions of
her virtues, cast a monstrous shadow over two generations;
yet there were books that reflected Marmontel’s wise
moderation, his sympathy with youthful follies, all that
was implied in the motto of his bon Curé, “<i>Moins de
prudence et plus de bonté</i>”.</p>

<p>The Nursery had its Marmontel in Armand Berquin,
better known by the name of his most famous book, <i>L’Ami
des Enfans</i>,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> an addition that no man deserved better then
he. Like Perrault, Berquin owed his reputation to a book
that he wrote for children; but times had changed: education
had now become of so much consequence that the
writer of children’s books was regarded as a public benefactor.
Perrault the Academician had never openly acknowledged
the <i>Contes</i> of 1697; but in 1784, Berquin’s <i>L’Ami
des Enfans</i> was crowned by the French Academy.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was well for Berquin that by this time fairies
were discredited in France, and Perrault was gone from
his old shelf, so that no child could choose between them.
As it was, children of all sizes and conditions, with and
without tutors, but all equally ignorant of magic, read
Berquin’s stories and read them again. Something of his
own sweetness and humour got into his book; they felt
that he loved and understood them, and those who lived
near him used to crowd round him, eager for a word or a
handshake, whenever he came out of his house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>Berquin’s book owes something to Weisse’s <i>Der Kinderfreund</i>,
from which he took some of the stories, as well as
to the writings of Campe and Salzmann; but no German
ever pointed a moral with such playful grace.</p>

<p>There is hardly a point in Rousseau’s argument that
Berquin does not illustrate; but he does it in a perfectly
natural way, drawing the events out of simple situations,
and showing delightful glimpses of childish character.</p>

<p>Marmontel’s “Bad Mother”, with her blind and cruel
preference for one of her two children, is easily recognised
in the story of “<i>Philippine et Maximin</i>”. His device
of moral contrast appears in every variation of Rousseau’s
theme.</p>

<p>These are mostly little studies in black and white:
Industry opposed to Idleness in “The Two Apple Trees”;
a rational education preferred to riches in the story of
Narcisse and Hippolyte; the character-contrast grafted
on fable in a similar study of two dogs.</p>

<p>Emile’s gentle consciousness of his dependence on others
(one of his more amiable traits) is shown in the docility of
Prosper, who, by accepting the gardener’s advice, finds in
due season ripe strawberries of an exquisite flavour hanging
from his plants. “Ah, had I only planted some in
my garden,” cries the brother who jeered at him. Whereupon
the generous one replies: “You can eat them as if
they were your own.”</p>

<p>M. Sage, who might be Emile’s tutor, believes that if
he can make his boy Philippe content with what he has,
instead of longing for things which he cannot get, he will
do more for his happiness than by leaving him untold
wealth.</p>

<p>When the boy envies a rich man’s garden, his father
says that he himself possesses a finer one. Taking Philippe
by the hand, he leads him to the top of a hill that overlooks
the open country. “Shall we soon come to our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
garden, papa?” the boy asks eagerly. “We are already
there!” answers M. Sage.</p>

<p>Rousseau himself was not a greater lover of gardens
than Berquin. Gardening is the theme of half his stories:
“<i>Le rosier à cent feuilles et le genêt d’Espagne</i>”; “<i>Les
cerises</i>”; “<i>Les tulipes</i>”; “<i>Les fraises et les grosseilles</i>”;
“<i>Les deux pommiers</i>”; the greater number
deal with country life and have their setting in the family.</p>

<p>The tale of the farmer who brings a jar of candied fruits
to his landlord’s children, is an eloquent sermon against
ill-breeding and prejudice.</p>

<p>This is a sequence of moral contrasts. First, the insolent
treatment of the farmer by the two boys is set against
their little sister’s courtesy, then contrasted with the
simple friendliness of their father; and the corresponding
scene of their entertainment at the farm is drawn with the
same delicate point. The two boys are compared with the
farmer’s sons, more capable, even more accomplished than
themselves; and stung to shame by the generosity and
natural courtesy of their host.</p>

<p>Farming, according to Rousseau, is the most honourable
of industries. After farmers he places blacksmiths and
carpenters. Berquin brings his children into a natural
contact with men of various crafts, the farmer, the blacksmith,
the mason. They watch the building of a house and
learn the need for division of labour. He can dispense with
Rousseau’s artifice. He never hampers himself with
theory, but allows Emile’s virtues to appear in common
adventures with men and birds and animals.</p>

<p>Clementine, who loads the little peasant girl with useless
gifts, learns, in a dialogue with her mother, to serve the real
needs of her protegée; the dentist’s visit to Laurette and
Marcellin is a test of courage; “<i>Le menteur corrigé par
lui-même</i>” becomes a champion of truth.</p>

<p>Foolish wishes and false judgments are corrected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
according to Rousseau’s plan. Little Fleuri, who, as each
new season arrives, would have it last for ever, is made to
set down his fickle desires on his father’s tablets, and, faced
in Autumn with his Winter, Spring and Summer wishes,
decides that all the seasons of the year are good. Armand
would cut away the brambles that take toll of the sheep’s
wool, but in the nesting season, discovers how the wool is
used.</p>

<p>Berquin cannot bring himself to judge the things that
are merely beautiful by Rousseau’s standard of utility.
Lucette, when she finds gay flowers in a place where her
father planted those “<i>tristes oignons</i>”, learns with astonishment
that these were tulip-roots; and Berquin allows her
to rejoice where a rigid Rousseauist would have compared
the uses of flowers and vegetables.</p>

<p>“The time of faults is the time for fables,” said Rousseau;
but he put it late, when Emile was no longer a child.
Berquin knows what happens in nurseries: that Josephine
will forget to feed her canary, that Firmin and Julie will
eat forbidden cherries, that Ferdinand, all frankness and
generosity, if he cannot control his temper, will be a danger
to his friends, and Camille if they give her the chance, will
tyrannise over the whole family.</p>

<p>The remedies are mostly found in the natural consequences
of these things; but Berquin brushes aside
Rousseau’s strict law of necessity with a light mischievous
touch; nor does he ever sanction the plan of governing
a child by letting him suppose he is the master.</p>

<p>“The Children who wanted to govern themselves”,
having tried it, do not wish to repeat the experiment; and
Camille is completely reduced by the officer who advises
her Mother to give her <i>a uniform and a pair of moustaches</i>,
in which she can more appropriately indulge her fancy
for ordering people about.</p>

<p>These children of Berquin’s are less hard and self-reliant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
than Emile. Even the good ones are not unnatural.
There is little Alexis on a showery day in June, running
first down to the garden to look at the sky, and then back,
three steps at a time, to the barometer—only to find that
the two are in league against him; and the eight-years-old
Marthonie, a delicious picture in her white linen dress,
a pair of morocco shoes on her “dear little feet”, and her
hair, dark as ebony, hanging in loose curls on her shoulders;
Marthonie, who insisted on being dressed for a picnic in a
frock of the prettiest apple-green taffetas, with rose-coloured
ribbons and shoes—and came home hatless and
draggled, a tearful Cinderella with one shoe left in the mud.
The Mother who met her thus and only said, “Would you
like me to have another silk frock made up for you to-morrow?”
owes her wisdom to Rousseau, but her playful
irony to Berquin and Marmontel.</p>

<p>Berquin’s parents are nearly infallible, but he does not
give them every point in an argument. In the affair of
Charlotte and the watch, for example, it is not always M.
de Fonrose who scores.</p>

<p>Charlotte invents a dozen reasons for wanting a watch,
and her inexorable parent disposes of them all, till she is
forced back on Rousseau’s final position. A watch must
needs be a <i>useful</i> possession, since her Papa, philosopher
as he is, cannot do without it. This, obviously, is a point
to Charlotte. If she wants the thing for its <i>usefulness</i>, it
is hers. The sudden capitulation is too much for Charlotte.
She suspects her Papa of badinage. Not at all; he is
perfectly serious. She will find the watch hanging from
the tapestry by the side of his bed.</p>

<p>Few English children could buy the first translation of
Berquin, in twenty-four volumes. A selection, including
many little dramas for three or four persons, appeared
later under the title of <i>The Children’s Friend</i>; but the true
English version was the admirable <i>Looking Glass for the
Mind</i><a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> adapted by Mr. Cooper for E. Newbery and illustrated
by John Bewick’s inimitable cuts. Alexis transfers
his best grace to Bewick’s “little Anthony”, standing
a-tiptoe on a chair to read the barometer; Caroline walks
as proudly as Marthonie in her finery; and the four little
pupils of Mademoiselle Boulon are not less French for their
English names.</p>

<p>It is odd, considering Rousseau’s attitude to the education
of girls (for in his account of Sophie he reverses the
whole method of Emile’s training) that the trilogy of
educational romance, begun with Emile, should have been
completed by two women.</p>

<p>Madame d’Epinay, Rousseau’s friend and benefactress,
published her <i>Conversations d’Emilie</i><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> at his request, and
Madame de Genlis, in <i>Adèle et Théodore</i>,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> worked out her
own scheme of practical education on his principles.</p>

<p>Of the two, Madame d’Epinay is more faithful to
Rousseau, and so great was the interest aroused by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
<i>Emile</i>, that she was awarded the French Academy prize
for “a work of the greatest benefit to humanity”.</p>

<p>She herself declared that her book contained “neither
a plan of education, nor any connection in the ideas”;
yet it is plain that Emilie follows Emile like an obedient
younger sister.</p>

<p>An age that believed in freedom and equality could not
long stand by the privilege of sex, and Emilie, although she
suffers some of the restrictions imposed on Sophie, shares
the natural education of Emile, and is taught to practise
most of his virtues. She gains her knowledge, as he does,
from experience; Nature is the wise Mistress who refuses
her request for more lessons, and had Emilie’s mother
followed her own inclination, it is likely that the little girl
at ten years old “Would not yet have known how to read.”</p>

<p>As it is, she is allowed to spend ten years (for Emile’s
twelve) in jumping and running, and her enlightened
Parent (the counterpart of Emile’s guardian) believes that
the time has not been wasted. Not that Emilie is ever
allowed to forget Rousseau’s Salic Law concerning
obedience and restraint. She is sternly snubbed for
romping with her brothers, and after a disastrous adventure
with a beautiful green ladder, admonished that “the
modesty of her sex requires a decorum which should
restrain the giddiness and warmth even of childhood”.
This sends her back to her doll, the care of which has so
far exercised her ingenuity that her mother “will not
oppose a continuation of it for some time to come”. And
to Sophie’s sewing and embroidery, Emilie adds a new
amusement: that of passing these instructive conversations
on to her doll.</p>

<p>Thus even “moments of relaxation” are to be employed
by a vigilant mother in order to form the understanding
of her child. There is no escape for little Emilie, she must
be educated every minute of the day. Her play is always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
under supervision, always liable to interference and
criticism. Her mother, usually her sole companion, is
present at all interviews between Emilie and other human
creatures.</p>

<p>The book is, in one sense, a simplified <i>Emile</i>, intended for
children as well as parents; but Madame d’Epinay has not
a vestige of Berquin’s humour to help her along the “paths
of pleasure and amusement”. These repeated portraits
of Emilie and her mother look dull indeed beside Berquin’s
dainty groups, and her insistent doctrine almost hides the
one beauty of the book: the character of Emilie.</p>

<p>There is no merit in Madame d’Epinay’s fancy portrait
of herself as the Perfect Parent, but Emilie is lifelike, and
holds out for a number of years in her stronghold of childhood.
It is only on the eve of her tenth birthday that she
remarks resignedly, “To-morrow will be an important
day. When I rise, <i>I shall no longer be a child</i>”.</p>

<p>The tyranny of reason had, in fact, begun much sooner,
when Emilie, curious about her own small part in the
Universe, learnt that <i>in time</i> she would become a Reasonable
Being.</p>

<p>This is a priceless opportunity to impress the lesson of
dependence,—to prove that it is only by mildness, docility
and attention that she can hope for a continuation of help
and protection.</p>

<p>Punishment, says the Maternal Governess, is proper
only for intractable and servile dispositions; but she is
willing, before Rousseau, to correct faults by means of
Fables.</p>

<p>This is how she deals with her pupil after a courageous

<p>(The very snap of the consonants can be heard.)</p>

<p>Madame d’Epinay was too true a disciple of Rousseau to
follow him slavishly. Not only did she ignore his strictures
upon reading, through the fear of being singular, and still
more that of making an unfortunate experiment, but she
was even ready to tolerate myths for the sake of morality,
and to compare them with modern instances; on the other
hand, it must be confessed that she only once talked of
fairies, and regretted it afterwards.</p>

<p>Emilie herself has a child’s love of fairies; but she is made
to reason about them:</p>

<p>“Mamma, you will make me umpire between you and the
fairies,” says the intelligent little person, making the most
of her dull game; and she obediently works it out against
herself: “They were, perhaps, two fairies and a genii I
met this morning. Well, no matter, Heaven bless them,
I say, you are the fairy Luminous and have <i>disenchanted
me</i>!”</p>

<p>The Mother never shrinks from this grave responsibility.
Berquin, though he made war upon ghosts, was
wise enough to let the fairies alone. At least he could
laugh like one of them. But Madame d’Epinay, in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
first Conversation with Emilie, finds it hard to be amused,
and in the twelfth, the little girl declares: “<i>In my whole
life I never saw you play at anything</i>”.</p>

<p>This, indeed, is a mother that sends Love himself to
school:</p>

<p>Madame de Genlis’s <i>Adèle et Théodore</i>, published in the
same year as <i>Emilie</i>, gives her interpretation of Rousseau
in the form of correspondence with a mother who desires
to be enlightened, but as yet clings to the ordinary customs
of Society:</p>

<p>“You prevent your children till the age of thirteen from
reading Telemachus, Fontaine’s Fables and all such books,
yet you would inspire them with a taste for reading!
What books would you give them instead of those I
have mentioned? Are they only to read the Arabian
Nights and Fairy Tales till they are thirteen?”</p>

<p>The answer gives the author’s convictions about
children’s books:</p>

<p>“I neither give my children Fairy Tales to read nor
Arabian Nights; not even Madame d’Aulnoy’s Fables,
which were composed for this purpose. <i>There is scarcely
one of them which has a moral tendency.</i>”</p>

<p>To provide works “proper for infancy” she wrote <i>Les
Veillées du Château</i>,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> tales which carry Rousseau’s theories
along a facile stream of conversation and incident. Adèle,
until she is seven, is allowed to read no other books. “I
shall then”, says Madame de Genlis, “give her the Conversations
of Emilie, a book you have often heard me praise,
and this will employ her till she is eight.”</p>

<p>The apparent generosity to her rival, however, did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
prevent the writer of <i>Adèle et Théodore</i> from attributing
the success of <i>Emilie</i> to the good will of the Encyclopædists.
“Madame d’Epinay was a philosopher,” she remarks,
“and took good care not to talk of religion to her Emilie.”</p>

<p>It is certainly true that Madame de Genlis had many
qualifications for her task which Madame d’Epinay
lacked; and when for a moment she allows herself to forget
her theories, there are glimpses of autobiography in her
books. Her own life, in fact, was the most interesting of
her tales, and the rest are interesting chiefly for reflections
of it.</p>

<p>No child could have reproached Madame de Genlis
with never playing at anything. She had an extraordinary
childhood, and her early years in the quiet Château of St.
Aubin were filled with unusual interests.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> At eight years
old she dictated little romances and comedies to her governess,
and amused herself by playing schoolmistress to some
Burgundian peasant children who came to cut rushes
under her window; at eleven she was the chief attraction
of her mother’s theatrical fêtes. It was characteristic
of the society of the day to seek refuge in private theatres
from political and social realities; most owners of country
houses had their own companies composed of friends and
neighbours, and thus Félicie, before her twelfth year, had
mixed freely with gentlefolk and villagers, and had shown
the aptitude for teaching and acting which marked her
whole career. Her dramatic talent, indeed, might be
said to cover all her other activities, for with her, teaching
was little more than a favourite and particularly successful
rôle. She was active, curious and enterprising as any
child; before her marriage she was an accomplished harpist
and fluent writer; afterwards she acquired a knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
of literature, anatomy, music and flower-painting; but
there were other occupations which fitted her even better
to be the exponent of Rousseau’s theories. Writing in
the <i>Memoirs</i> of her early married life, “I endeavoured”,
she says, “to gain some insight into field-labour an
gardening. I went to see the cider made. I went to watch
all the workmen in the village at work, the carpenter,
the weaver, the basket maker”.</p>

<p>Rousseau thought her the most natural and cheerful
girl he had ever met. Their friendship was short, but she
never wavered in her loyalty to his teaching, and could say
at the age of seventy, “What I pride myself on, is knowing
twenty trades, by all of which I could earn my bread.”</p>

<p>In 1777, Madame de Genlis was made governess to the
daughters of the Duchess of Chartres, for whom, with her
own children, she established a school at the Convent of
Belle Chasse. Her success was so great that, in 1782, the
Duke of Orleans took the unusual step of appointing her
as “governor” to his three sons. The result fully justified
his courage and silenced the critics who ridiculed this new
method of using revolutionary theory to educate princes.</p>

<p>The Duke purchased a country estate at St. Leu, and
here the boys made experiments in chemistry, studied
botany, practised gardening, carpentry, and other forms of
handwork. But Madame de Genlis did more than play
the part of Rousseau with three Emiles. She handed on
to her pupils the delights of her own childhood. These
boys could laugh at Emile marooned in his island. They
played out a dozen different Voyages in the park of St.
Leu; and had a theatre of their own in which they acted
moral plays from the <i>Théâtre d’Education</i>.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Madame de Genlis had long ago added authorship to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
her list of trades and had written stories for the children of
Belle Chasse. It was easy enough to invent new ones for St.
Leu. “There is no great wisdom required in the composition,”
she declared, “but only Nature and common sense.”</p>

<p>Doubtless her books deserved Madame Guizot’s criticism,
“<i>toujours bien et jamais mieux</i>”. She is discursive, even
garrulous, and often loses the thread of the story in moral
dialogues; but there are tales in the <i>Veillées du Château</i>
that suggest her own enjoyment of the “delicious life”
with her children; and if none of them betray her love of
mischief and adventure, it is but a fresh proof that she was
acting a part, that she could not move freely under the
cloak of the Infallible Parent. For in actual life she could
take either side in a moral contrast, bear her part in the
maddest pranks, assume every virtue of a heroine and hide
with complete success a thousand faults.</p>

<p>Her books, after all, were simply properties reserved for
her parts of Moralist and Schoolmistress. She dramatised
the theories of Rousseau, and although her wonderful
energy hardly atoned for her lack of depth and soundness,
she left a rich legacy of device and suggestion to those who
could use it better.</p>

<p>Rousseau’s affinity to Locke on the side of theory, and
to Richardson in sentiment may account for some common
features of French and English tales, but it does not explain
the writing of “Lilliputian” books by two such authors
as Berquin and Madame de Genlis.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no great difference between “writing
down” Rousseau’s doctrine for children, and making
miniature versions of Richardson and La Bruyère; but
Berquin’s humour should have saved him from <i>Le Petit
Grandison</i>,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and Madame de Genlis might have reflected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
on the undramatic qualities of <i>Le Petit La Bruyère</i>.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Berquin’s Lilliputian hero reveals himself in letters to his
mother as a perfect miniature of Sir Charles Grandison,
not less insufferable for his youth; and the little <i>La
Bruyère</i> is made up of conventional homilies: “Of Reading,
Study and Application”; “Of Personal Merit”;
“Of the Heart” (introduced by a quotation from Marmontel);
“Of Insipidity” (perhaps evoked by the other
platitudes).</p>

<p>It was Rousseau himself who saw that the subject of
education was entirely new, even after Locke’s treatise,
and would be new after his own. The closest of his
followers overlooked his chief discovery.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ENGLISH SCHOOL OF ROUSSEAU</span></h2>

<p>Effects of Rousseau’s teaching in England—Henry Brooke’s
<i>Fool of Quality</i>, the English <i>Emile</i>—Thomas Day: his connection
with the Edgeworths—<i>Sandford and Merton</i>—<i>Little Jack</i>—Theory
and Romance: Philip Quarll as a Rousseauist—<i>The New Robinson
Crusoe</i>—Madame d’Epinay and Mary Wollstonecraft: <i>The Original
Stories</i>—Blake’s illustrations—Traces of Marmontel and Madame
le Prince de Beaumont in <i>The Juvenile Tatler</i> and <i>The Fairy
Spectator</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>In England, Rousseau’s teaching had more effect on
the actual life of the family than on books. Children,
no longer cramped by the old pedantries, began to
show unexpected powers of action and self-control,
and parents, relieved of their harsher duties, chose
to make friends rather than philosophers of their
children.</p>

<p>It was only in books that theorists could represent this
genuine progress by the make-believe of impossible children
and perfect parents. Most writers of children’s books
were theorists of one sort or another, and now that they
had begun to draw from life, they tried to make it fit their
theories. Thus the new books were hardly less didactic
than the old.</p>

<p>Some reflect Johnson’s hostility to Rousseau, others
support the new ideas with definite religious teaching, and
many that present the Child of Nature as an existing type,
endow him with the precocious wisdom of a Lilliputian.
There is hardly a book among them, even among the many
adaptations of French stories, in which the setting and
characters are not plainly English.</p>

<p>The most consistent of all Rousseauists was Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Day,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> the author of <i>Sandford and Merton</i>,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and he owed
the success of his book at least as much to his own observations
and experiments, as to Rousseau.</p>

<p>Much of its interest, moreover, can be traced to the
example of an English novelist; for in choosing some
pieces for children from Henry Brooke’s <i>Fool of Quality</i>,
Mr. Day had been so struck by its simple and vivid style
as to regret that Brooke himself had not written books for
children; and it is clear that, while the theory of <i>Sandford
and Merton</i> came direct from Rousseau, many dramatic
situations, which are the life of the story, were suggested
by <i>The Fool of Quality</i>.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>This, indeed, was a book after Rousseau’s own heart.
The hero, Henry Earl of Moreland, is an English Emile
quickened out of knowledge by more natural and livelier
adventures. Brought up by a foster-mother among village
children, he stands for the virtues of a natural education,
against a brother bred at home in the luxurious fashion
of the time. The scene of his first visit (at five years old)
to his parents, is a satire on Society, and the farcical turn
of his adventures brings the romance of theory into touch
with the novel of life and humour. This little Harry is
the most natural child of fiction; like Emile at a later
stage, he knows nothing of the respect due to people of
rank, and is quite unmoved by his unusual surroundings;
but as yet he has no philosophy; he values things as
children do, for what they mean to him. A laced hat is
useless as a head-covering, but an effective missile for
playing ducks and drakes among the wine-glasses; when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
he gets astride a Spanish pointer and rides him among the
company, he sees no reason to dismount because the dog,
growing outrageous, rushes into a group of little masters
and misses and overthrows them like ninepins; and when
he has crowned the adventure by throwing down a fat
elderly lady and three men, he arises and strolls leisurely
about the room “with as unconcerned an aspect as if
nothing had happened amiss, and as though he had neither
art nor part in this frightful discomfiture”.</p>

<p>Emile, a much older boy, at his dinner party, received
a hint from his mentor, and for the rest of the meal “philosophised
all alone in his corner” about luxury, superior
all to the grown-up guests. The little Harry, merely
unhappy at having to hold his knife and fork “just so”
and say so many “my lords and my ladies”, very naturally
cries, “I wish I was with my mammy in the kitchen.”
Neither then nor at any other time does he seem conscious
of superior wisdom; but Theory hangs upon the foolishness
of his mother. An uncle, whimsical rather than
didactic, but none the less a moralist, fills the place of
Rousseau’s tutor, and later, when the boy appears in
clothes “trimmed like those of your beau insects vulgarly
called butterflies,” this humorist so impresses him with
the comparison of that “good and clever boy called
Hercules” who was given a poisoned coat to wear, that
Harry rips and rends the lacings of his suit and runs down
to obey a summons “with half the trimmings hanging in
fritters and tatters about him.”</p>

<p>Where Emile was controlled and self-centred, Harry is
all impulse and warmth of heart. He fights like a little
tiger to avenge his brother or to punish some young scamp,
and cares little for the opinion of his fellows; yet he shows
the greatest tenderness to animals or persons in distress.
His mother, seeking proof of his wits and finding him
ready to give away all his clothes except his shirt, decides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
that “there is but the thickness of a bit of linen between
this child and a downright fool”, and so leaves him to his
more discerning father.</p>

<p>At times, the author, preoccupied with social and
political ideals, so neglects the story that even his lively
humour can scarce restore it; yet he can forget Rousseau’s
theories in scenes that he invents to illustrate them; nor
does he ever accept a theory without proof. To the
philosopher’s contention “that self-love is the motive to
all human actions”, Brooke answers in the words of the
estimable Mr. Meekly, “Virtue forbid”; and his own
philosophy is the sounder for a trustworthy ballast of
religion and patriotism.</p>

<p>Among minor digressions are a dialogue about toys,
another on ghosts, and some of the “thousand little
fables” by which Harry’s uncle, “with the most winning
and insinuating address, endeavoured to open his mind
and cultivate his morals”. One of these, “The Fable of
the Little Silver Trouts”, has a tenderness that sets it
apart from common fables. It reads like an Irish folk-tale
moralised by some good priest.</p>

<p>If Henry Brooke could have passed on his gifts of
humour and sympathy to the writers of children’s books,
they would have known better than to tie life down to
theory. As it was, they were mostly obsessed by the
desire to teach, and preferred Mr. Day’s model of a faultless
hero to one like the Fool of Quality, who actually
discovered two boys within him, one “proud, scornful,
ostentatious and revengeful”, the other “humble, gentle,
generous, loving and forgiving”.</p>

<p>This English Emile was a moral contrast in himself, an
anomaly that might weaken every “Example” in moral tales.</p>

<p>Thomas Day would have no such compromise between
good and evil. Moral truths were best expressed by distinct
types. To combine these in one person was to confuse the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
issue. Mr. Day lived, as he wrote, to prove his theories,
and whenever the unknown quantity of human nature
thwarted him, went back to them with unshaken confidence.
A great part of his life was given to works of active benevolence,
and his death was no less consistent than his life;
for he died in trying to prove that a young horse could
be tamed by kindness.</p>

<p>Only once he seems to have acted in what must have
seemed to him an irrational way, and that was at the
request of the lady (Miss Elizabeth Sneyd) whom at that
time he hoped to make his wife. With his natural propensity
to improve and educate, he had asked her, in
preparation for their future life, to forgo many pleasant
and harmless diversions which seemed to him useless or
unreasonable. Miss Sneyd, with proper spirit, suggested
that a French dancing-master might help Mr. Day to overcome
certain faults of deportment which displeased her,
and so nice was his sense of justice, that he actually crossed
to France and spent some time in a hopeless experiment.
Nobody could have taught Mr. Day to dance; perhaps the
lady knew it. Such graces as he managed to acquire only
provoked her to say that she liked him better as he was
before, and he retired to console himself with philosophy.</p>

<p>His next venture promised better success. He resolved
to educate two orphan girls upon Rousseau’s plan, so that,
in time, one of them might fill the place he had intended for
Miss Sneyd. But Nature again proved herself too strong
for Philosophy. The children quarrelled, refused to be
educated “in Reason’s plain and simple way”, and could
not be cured of shrieking when their guardian frightened
them to test their courage. As they grew up, he was
forced to admit another failure; but he clung to his
theories, and oddly enough lost nothing of his belief in
the reasonableness of “female character”. A later pupil
of his more than justified this confidence. Richard Lovell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Edgeworth, although he had been Day’s successful rival in
love, was still his friend, and used to send his little daughter
Maria to spend her holidays with him. By that time Mr.
Day had found a lady who could endure his ways, and was
settled in Essex, busy with schemes for the benefit of his
poor neighbours.</p>

<p>Maria Edgeworth, fresh from a conventional boarding
school, was quick to appreciate his odd humours and
philosophic mind. She obediently swallowed his doses of
tar-water, submitted to the severest tests in exact reasoning,
and under his influence, acquired that intense regard
for truth which stamped all her later writings. Yet it
was not through any theories derived from him or from her
father that she became the greatest writer of Moral Tales,
but through her own experience of life and character; and
her work for children must be considered apart from her
Rousseauist principles. Mr. Day, indeed, whose ideal of
womanhood was in some ways little in advance of Rousseau’s,
did his best to crush her first effort (the translation
of <i>Adèle et Théodore</i>) by expostulating with her father for
encouraging it; but Maria was too much his pupil to give
way to a prejudice based solely on his horror of “female
authorship”.</p>

<p>Mr. Day was fully alive to the want of good books for
children; not only did he put his own talents at their
service, by contributing to Mr. Edgeworth’s instructive
serial <i>Harry and Lucy</i>,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> but he found the task so interesting
that it grew into an independent volume, three parts
dissertation and experiment, and the fourth a fresh effort
to express life in terms of theory.</p>

<p>Doubtless he found it a relief to work out in a book the
experiments which he had found so disconcerting in
practice: to show, as the result of his system, a super-Fool of
Quality,—a farmer’s son, instead of a nobleman’s,—and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
make his foil the spoilt child of rich parents. These are
the two children, Harry Sandford and Tommy Merton,
“introduced as the actors” to give interest and coherence to
Mr. Day’s collection of lessons and stories.</p>

<p>When he says they are “made to speak and behave
according to the order of Nature,” “Nature” must be
understood to mean the “natural” result of Theory; for it
is only the Bad Boy who, in his naughtiness, is a real child
of Nature. The Good Boy of the Moralist is a stock figure
of allegory, but the Bad Boy lives; a hundred models will
serve for his portrait. He is the real hero of <i>Sandford and
Merton</i>, as Satan is of <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, even in a book, human nature was too much for
Mr. Day; and yet his Good Boy, Harry Sandford, is something
more than the good half of the Fool of Quality.
His virtues, although superhuman, are not unlike those of
the youthful Thomas Day; but under the guidance of Mr.
Barlow, that insufferable model of the Perfect Tutor, he
exhibits the mature head of Mr. Day on young shoulders,
and so becomes the mouthpiece of Rousseau, the lay-preacher
of Mr. Barlow’s sermons, and the chief instrument
of the Bad Boy’s reformation.</p>

<p>There is a note of English severity in Mr. Day’s reading
of Rousseau. His notion of self-control is stricter than
anything in the <i>Emile</i>: “Mr. Barlow says we must only
eat when we are hungry and drink when we are dry”;
he is utterly intolerant of wealth: “The rich do nothing
and produce nothing, the poor everything that is really
useful”. Mr. Barlow, Harry Sandford and the amiable
Miss Simmons take it in turns to express Mr. Day’s opinions
of the idle and frivolous pastimes of Society. Mr. Barlow
was “an odd kind of man who never went to assemblies
and played upon no kind of instrument,” he was “not
fond of cards” and preferred relating moral histories.
Harry Sandford found the theatre “full of nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
cheating and dissimulation;” and when the youthful
guests of Tommy’s house-party were preparing for a Ball,
“Miss Simmons alone appeared to consider the approaching
<i>solemnity</i> with perfect indifference”.</p>

<p>Much of this is autobiography. Under the figure of
Miss Simmons’s uncle, Mr. Day, in fact, discloses himself:
“a man of sense and benevolence, but a very great
humorist”. It is his humour to look at the world as his
poor boy looks at the rich man’s house:</p>

<p>“To the great surprise of everybody, he neither appeared
pleased nor surprised at anything he saw.”</p>

<p>Many incidents of the story, which, like the fight
between Harry and Master Mash, owe little to Henry
Brooke, may be taken as reminiscent of Mr. Day’s boyhood;
for although he has a true instinct for drama, he
is incapable of pure invention.</p>

<p>“The originality of the author” he says “is a point of
the least consequence in the execution of such a work as
this”. Harry Sandford refusing to betray the hare to the
huntsman, or at loggerheads with the “little gentry”, is
the Fool of Quality; but when he discusses the World with
Miss Simmons, he is a brother of the philosophic Emile.</p>

<p>Mr. Day borrows many of his instructive details from
Rousseau: the juggler, who taught Emile the use of
magnets by means of an artificial duck, conspires with
Mr. Barlow and Harry to teach the uninformed Tommy
Merton; but there are other experiments more practical
than Rousseau’s, which suggest actual experience and the
co-operation of Mr. Edgeworth. These alternate with
short tales introduced according to what Mr. Day calls
the “natural order of association”; but their effect is to
weaken the genuine interest of the enveloping story.
“The Gentleman and the Basket Maker”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> gains nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
by the Good Boy’s elocution; Leonidas shakes himself
free from Mr. Barlow’s patronage.</p>

<p>Yet, with all these digressions, children found matter
of interest in <i>Sandford and Merton</i> for another century.
The most didactic parents could not have controlled the
choice of so many nurseries, nor would Mr. Day accept
a grown-up verdict without the children’s assent. “If
they are uninterested in the work”, he wrote in his preface,
“the praises of a hundred reviewers will not console me
for my failure”.</p>

<p>The truth is that persons who stand no higher than Mr.
Barlow’s knee can go through the book without seeing much
of him.</p>

<p>The simple story of “Little Jack”, no less characteristic
of Day, appeared in <i>The Children’s Miscellany</i>: (1787),<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but
may have been written earlier. The moral is quite explicit;
“that it is of little consequence how a man comes into the
world, provided he behaves well and discharges his duty
when he is in it”; but Jack’s life begins at the edge of experience,
when he is suckled by a goat; and later, his duty
leads him into many adventures which, although they appear
true, happen in a romantic setting of foreign countries.</p>

<p>Thus theorists, without acknowledging romance, may
use it for their own purposes. Robinson Crusoe’s island
lent enchantment to Emile’s most practical employments,
and Rousseau’s followers chose two wholly romantic figures
to point their arguments against society. The negro, cut
off from his own people, freed from his oppressors, is a
striking and pathetic mark in the midst of his white brothers.
He now becomes a type of the Natural Man, and a hero
of children’s books.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The second witness against social
institutions is that first friend of children, the shipwrecked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
sailor-man in his island, who still holds them by the spell
of circumstance, even while he repeats the strange jargon
of revolutionary doctrines.</p>

<p>Mr. Day had transcribed, along with extracts from <i>The
Fool of Quality</i>, “some part of Robinson Crusoe”, without
any serious additions; but Philip Quarll the Hermit, one of
Crusoe’s earliest successors, appeared in <i>The Children’s
Miscellany</i> as a Rousseauist philosopher.</p>

<p>The original chap-book of 1727<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> has no suggestion of
theory, but it points out one vital difference between
Philip Quarll and Crusoe. Quarll actually comes to love
his solitude and loses all desire to return to his own country.</p>

<p>To the theorist, this proved him a forerunner of Rousseau,
and the editor of 1787 could furnish him with the latest
version of the creed. He begins by reflecting (as Rousseau
did with <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>) on the edifying spectacle of
shipwrecked men, “deprived in an instant of all the advantage
and support which are derived from mutual assistance
... obliged to call forth all the latent resources of their
own minds”; and then remarks that the story “whether real
or fictitious, is admirably adapted to the illustration of
the subject”.</p>

<p>The poetical language of this hermit, so unlike Crusoe’s
plain story, suggests the influence of Saint Pierre, whose
descriptions of scenery were more elaborate but less
vigorous than Rousseau’s. “Feathered Choristers” entertain
him “with melodious harmony;” Nature “puts on
her gay enamelled garb and out of her rich wardrobe
supplies all vegetables with new vesture.”</p>

<p>In such phrases, the philosophic hermit exalts Solitude
at the expense of Society.</p>

<p>There is much unconscious humour in the account of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the hermit’s efforts to overcome Nature, for although he
has some of Crusoe’s practical ability, he trusts rather to
theory. Depressed at the persistent hatred of a tribe of
monkeys, for whom he has dug roots, he meditates on its
cause, and deciding that he must have forfeited their
respect “by hiding the beauty of his fabric under a gaudy
disguise”, he discards the irrational garments which
distinguish men from monkeys, and presents in his own
person Rousseau’s Natural Man.</p>

<p>A friendly monkey, “Beau Fidèle”, plays the part of
Friday, and the “surprising tractability and good nature”
of this beast, contrasted with the ingratitude of a shipwrecked
sailor, strengthen the general argument.</p>

<p>This is how the Philosopher, after fifteen years in his
island, apostrophises a ship that suddenly appears:</p>

<p>“Unlucky invention! That thou shouldst ever come
into men’s thoughts! The Ark which gave the first notion
of a floating habitation, was ordered for the preservation
of man, but its fatal copies daily expose him to destruction”;
and when the sailors fail to take him off, “despite
a sudden impulse to return”, he reflects upon his good
fortune in having escaped the world, and counts his own
situation happier than theirs. There is, of course, no
Footprint in the Sand; yet the tale has romantic features.
A child might skip most of the descriptions, but he would
remember the white-bearded hermit and his monkey-servant
in their hut built of growing trees. Crusoe had
no such leaf-tapestry on his walls; and there is a map of
Philip Quarll’s island which is a formulary of romantic
truth; for in it may be seen (at A) the place where the
Hermit was cast away, and at B, the place where Mr.
Dorrington (who discovered him) landed; at E, the
Hermit’s Lodge, and at K, the lake between the Rock and
the Island.</p>

<p>The new <i>Philip Quarll</i> with all its absurdities was better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
reading for Children than <i>The New Robinson Crusoe</i>
(Campe’s <i>Robinson der Jüngere</i>, translated into English
from the French in 1788).<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Crusoe’s ship never carried a
heavier cargo than Campe’s tiresome family, who break up
the story with their dull colloquies; but the book is a
fresh proof that these philosophers had to call in the old
masters to enforce their lessons, and could discover no
more attractive theme than the old one of voyages and
islands.</p>

<p>The English <i>Conversations of Emily</i> appeared in the same
year as <i>The Children’s Miscellany</i>. Four years later,
Mary Wollstonecraft, full of theories for the better education
of girls, assumed the mantle of Madame d’Epinay,
or rather placed it on the shoulders of a Representative
whom no touch of human weakness could redeem from the
hard grip of Reason: Mrs. Mason, a monstrous creation
of her own.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It would be impossible to paint Mrs. Mason’s
portrait. Nothing softer than granite could suggest her
outline. Compared with her, Emily’s Mother is all kindness
and indulgence. Her two charges, Mary and Caroline,
are mere wax tablets whereon she records her impressions
of virtue. Their very faults are placed upon them like
labels, for Mrs. Mason to remove. Emily, though she was
her mother’s “friend”, was a real child, pleased and
amused by formal Nature lessons and unimaginative
stories, since nothing better might be had; playing with
dolls, “jumping, running about and making a noise”.</p>

<p>Mary, in the <i>Original Stories</i>, has to prove that she can
“regulate her appetites”, before Mrs. Mason says: “I
called her my friend, and she deserved the name, <i>for she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
was no longer a child</i>.” Mary and Caroline have no
mother; Mary Wollstonecraft had no confidence in
parents. She called in Mrs. Mason, a sort of moral
physician, to make good the defects of a casual up-bringing.
Mrs. Mason, true to the <i>tradition d’Epinay</i>, “never suffered
them to be out of her sight”. She exhibited every excellence
that she exhorted them to attain; and that none
of her perfections should escape their notice, she discoursed
upon these at intervals. Her success is inevitable and complete.
She conducts her pupils through carefully selected
experiences; she conducts the reader through the book.
She never hesitates or doubts; she never betrays surprise.</p>

<p>The Tales were written “to illustrate the Moral”: it
is thus that Mrs. Mason answers “the Ænigma of Creation”.
She sees everything, understands everything,
explains everything.</p>

<p>“‘I declare I cannot go to sleep’, said Mary, ‘I am
<i>afraid of Mrs. Mason’s eyes</i>’.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason conforms and makes everybody else conform
to her moral formulæ: “Do you know the meaning of the
word Goodness?” she asks. “I see you are unwilling to
answer. I will tell you. It is, first, to avoid hurting
anything; and then to continue to give as much pleasure
as you can.”</p>

<p>Three chapters are given to “the treatment of animals”.
The children are allowed to read Mrs. Trimmer’s <i>Fabulous
Histories</i>,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and to read it “over again” to a little friend,
if they can make her understand that <i>birds never talk</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Original Stories</i>, pleasure is administered like
medicine. Benevolence is a chief part of Mrs. Mason’s
Theory; she is resolutely, almost sternly benevolent.
Joy is never admitted without a dispensation from Reason.
When the children have acted “like rational creatures”,
Mrs. Mason allows them two lines of joy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“Look, what a fine morning it is. Insects, birds, and
animals, are all enjoying this sweet day.”</p>

<p>Blake snatched the words eagerly for his frontispiece.
His “illustrations” are a touchstone for Mary Wollstonecraft’s
imagination. <i>He could not draw Mrs. Mason.</i>
In her place he introduces a central figure of his own,
meditative, sweet, and firm; spiritual, even decorative,
as Mrs. Mason never was. Yet he, like the rest, was
dominated by the monstrous original; his Masonic Symbol
appears in every picture. The children are his own; he
dresses them to order, but makes haloes of their little round
straw hats.</p>

<p>This author has an effective manner of disposing landscape
to correspond with her sombre or determinedly
joyful moods. Blake does not attempt the moonlight
scene that moves Mrs. Mason to discourse upon her gloomy
past, and present resignation. “I am weaned from the
world, but not disgusted,” she observes. Such a state of
mind would be unintelligible to Blake. But he manages
to convey something of the formal desolation of the ruined
Mansion-house, to which Mrs. Mason brings the children
“to tell them the history of the last inhabitants”. They
cling about her, and one looks back in a vain hope of escape,
for “when they spoke, the sound seemed to return again,
as if unable to penetrate the thick stagnated air. The sun
could not dart its purifying rays through the thick gloom,
and the fallen leaves contributed to choke up the way and
render the air more noxious”. A heavy atmosphere is
characteristic of the book; it suggests the German <i>Elements
of Morality</i>, which Mary Wollstonecraft translated two
years later. The promise of romance in the settings of
Mrs. Mason’s stories is never fulfilled.</p>

<p>Blake was oppressed by her realistic solution of the
mystery of the unseen harper. He followed the “pleasing
sound” in his own way, and discovered the player for himself:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
not Mrs. Mason’s explicit and tangible old man, but a
spirit harping under a starry sky.</p>

<p>Neither Thomas Day nor Mary Wollstonecraft could
have written a “Lilliputian” book; and even the author
of the <i>Juvenile Tatler</i> and <i>Fairy Spectator</i>, whose titles
suggest the old traditions, turns back only to copy the types
of Marmontel, the moral fairy tales of Madame le Prince
de Beaumont.</p>

<p><i>The Juvenile Tatler</i>,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> by Mrs. Teachwell (Lady Fenn) is a
collection of moral dialogues and dramas: “The Foolish
Mother”, “The Prudent Daughter”, “The Innocent
Romp”, and others suggested by Marmontel. But the
characters are wholly English. The Innocent Romp is a
feminine counterpart of the Bad Boy.</p>

<p>The other persons of this drama (real people too) are
Mr. Briskly, a Widower, whom Marmontel would have
called “The Foolish Father”; Mrs. Freeman, his sister,
“The Wise Aunt”; Miss Prudence Freeman, her daughter,
“The Good Cousin”.</p>

<p>Lady Fenn’s humour is English, like her characters:
she invents amusing pranks for her heroine, and is original
in admitting a girl to the masculine pastime of mischief.</p>

<p>A very natural dialogue between the Foolish Father and
the Wise Aunt prepares the reader for the entrance of the
Romp. Her latest offence has lost her an eligible suitor.
Chasing the housemaid with a rotten apple, she has just
thrown it full in the face of Lord Prim, alighting from his
coach to pay his compliments to her, on her return from
school. Thus announced, she enters, fresh from an
excursion into a neighbour’s garden by way of the wall.
Questioned about the visible traces of this adventure,
she confesses that she fell from the top of the wall, and adds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
that she would like to fall twenty times if she could be
sure she was not seen, and <i>to make her cousin Prudence
fall too</i>. “La! Cousin,” she cries, with seductive enjoyment,
“’tis delightful! Just like flying.” (A cautious
foot-note explains: “This was written before the invention
of Air Balloons.”)</p>

<p>When the author has a doubt about the moral influence
of her heroine, she inserts a corrective foot-note.</p>

<p>The Romp, it is disclosed by her Aunt, not content with
dressing the cat in baby-linen to play at a mock-christening,
disguised herself as an old woman, and carried it to Mr.
Starchbland, the Curate. Upon this there are three
separate comments: The Foolish Father’s <i>“A profane
trick”</i>; The Wise Aunt’s “She thought no further than
the surprise it would be to the person who should lift up
the mantle and possibly”——Oh, excellent Wise Aunt!—“<i>possibly</i>,
the roguery of getting the parson scratched.”
And, last, the foot-note, to avert parental criticism:
“<i>Let it not be supposed that Miss B would suffer the Sacred
Rite to begin</i>”.</p>

<p>The author’s sympathies are with the Aunt (she was an
aunt herself). So the Wise Aunt carries off her niece to
undergo a moderate process of conversion. The Foolish
Father, who “dotes” upon his daughter “when she is
neatly dressed and tolerably sedate”, is obviously drawn
from life.</p>

<p><i>The Fairy Spectator</i>,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> “By Mrs. Teachwell and Her
Family”, is Mrs. Argus transformed into the Benevolent
Educational Fairy of Madame de Beaumont. Here is a
characteristic bit of dialogue:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Mrs. Teachwell</i>:</td>
    <td class="noindent">You know that stories of Fairies are all fabulous?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Miss Sprightly</i>:</td>
    <td class="noindent">Oh, yes! Madam.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Mrs. Teachwell</i>:</td>
    <td class="noindent">Do you wish for such a Fairy Guardian?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Miss Sprightly</i>:</td>
    <td class="noindent">Very much, Madam.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Mrs. Teachwell</i>:</td>
    <td class="noindent">Why, my dear?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Miss Sprightly</i>:</td>
    <td class="noindent"><i>Because she would teach me to be good.</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A world where all fairies are “fabulous” is, of course,
a world without dreams. When Miss Sprightly weeps on
rising, because she cannot banish the thought of “the most
pleasing dream which she ever had in her life”, the inexorable
Mrs. Teachwell meets the situation with a simple
formula: “Idle girl, make haste!” The Fabulous
Beings whom she admits on sufferance are not more
fairylike than “the smallest wax doll.”</p>

<p>Two lines from <i>The Fairy Spectator</i> betray the Rousseauist’s
attitude to Fairyland:</p>

<p>“I will write you a Dialogue in which the Fairy shall
converse, and <i>I will give you a Moral for your Dream</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The great writers for children were neither Lilliputian
nor Rousseauist. They emerged from a good
company of aunts and mothers who, with a sprinkling
of fathers, were driven into anonymous authorship
by the demands of their own families: minor moralists,
without any special gifts of art or imagination, who
managed to draw live pictures from their own little world,
and hit upon simple devices for holding attention and
exciting interest.</p>

<p>They were mostly innocent of Theory, but an intimate
acquaintance with the Child of Nature taught them in
one way or another to avoid the unpardonable sin of
dulness.</p>

<p>Little novels, following their grown-up prototypes with
unequal steps, had their own limitations of setting and
character. A nursery or a schoolroom is always a nursery
or a schoolroom, and varies only according to particular
houses and inhabitants. The few ways of escape (by a
window, a chimney or a keyhole) into fairyland, were
blocked in most eighteenth century houses, and the persons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
of moral tales, however lifelike, were apt, from contact
with a narrow circle, to assume familiar characters.</p>

<p>Adventures of the milder sort might happen on the road
to school, but the only changes of scene were from parlour to
schoolroom, or from town to country. Any effort to
exceed these by travels abroad landed the unsophisticated
author in a hopeless confusion of unknown tongues
and half-remembered directions.</p>

<p>And yet there was something in these English settings
to compensate a child for the loss of fairyland, if not to
set his feet in the track of it. Authors chiefly concerned
with character were apt to give the briefest indication
of a background; but before 1780, there were woodcuts
that implied more than the words of the story.</p>

<p>Thomas Bewick had cut his first blocks for the York
and Newcastle chap-books, and although he soon passed
on from these to a wider study of Nature, they were
enough to seal the fate of the old slovenly pictures in
children’s books.</p>

<p>As a boy, Bewick had filled the margins of his school-books
and covered the hearthstones of his mother’s cottage
with drawings of the men and beasts that he knew about
his native village<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>; and these he reproduced later in the
cuts for chap-books and fables.</p>

<p>He could never draw fairies. The “Pigmy Sprite” in
Gay’s <i>Fables</i><a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> is not half so fairy-like as the little spinning-wheels
and brooms of the corner-pieces; but his drawings
of trees and meadows, rocks and pools, show the “fairy
ground” of his own happy childhood.</p>

<p>It was thus that he gave a new meaning to the country
setting which was now a recognised feature of moral tales.
A writer might demand no more of Nature than that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
should provide the Industrious Boy with fruit in
season; but Bewick caught her among the corn ricks
or at the corner of a lane, and she herself took up the
parable.</p>

<p>The younger brother, John, who began by adapting
some of Bewick’s drawings, is better known as an illustrator
of children’s books. Between 1790 and 1820, there are few
cuts that do not show some trace of his influence, and many
of those in the smaller chap-books,—<i>The Adventures of a
Pincushion</i>, for example, and <i>The Life and Adventures of
a Fly</i>,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>—have been attributed to him.</p>

<p>In a sense, John was more imaginative than his brother,
quicker to appreciate subtleties of character and expression.
There is hardly less truth of detail in the Lime-walks
and rose-gardens of <i>The Looking Glass for the Mind</i>
than in Thomas Bewick’s village scenes; but the little
figures are more graceful and courtly, the backgrounds
more delicate.</p>

<p>John Bewick’s illustrations to <i>The New Robinson Crusoe</i>
gave shape to Rousseau’s vague ideal; but his pictures
of English children in their natural surroundings were a
literal return to Nature. And although they were in
complete accord with the changed attitude of the story-writers,
they proved (to the confusion of Theorists) that
the new Philosophy had made little impression on the
familiar moods of Nature and childhood.</p>

<p>The School-setting, however cramped, was a source of
wider interest than the alternative parlour or nursery.
It varied, according to the fortunes of the persons concerned,
from the Village School (commonly built on the
<i>Two-Shoes</i> foundation, but without its Lilliputian features)
to the Academy for young Ladies or Gentlemen: an
exclusive community which had received its traditions
from Sarah Fielding’s notable little book <i>The Governess</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
or, <i>The Little Female Academy</i><a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> published some fourteen
years before Rousseau’s <i>Emile</i>.</p>

<p>Writing in the first decade of Lilliputian books, the
author of <i>David Simple</i> anticipated Rousseau with a gallery
of children’s portraits, and showed that the Child of Nature
could survive pedantic forms as well as theories.</p>

<p>Madame le Prince de Beaumont chose the same framework
for her <i>Misses’ Magazine</i>;<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Charles and Mary Lamb
used it to connect the separate stories of <i>Mrs. Leicester’s
School</i>; Mrs. Sherwood seized upon the book itself and
revised it ruthlessly, and a host of anonymous writers
copied Miss Fielding’s method and envied her genius.</p>

<p>Half periodical, half novel, <i>The Governess</i> was a perfect
medium for “Instruction and Amusement”. It contains
sermons, fables, Oriental-Classic stories and a moralised
romance in the style of the <i>Cabinet des Fées</i>.</p>

<p>Of the Governess herself, whose name of Mrs. Teachum
became a popular pseudonym for instructive writers,
it must be confessed that she is a Presence hardly less
dominating than Mrs. Mason. To the mature reader,
who is uncomfortably conscious of having met her in real
life, she is more formidable than any lay-figure of a theorist.
Her husband, described as “a very sensible Man who took
great Delight in improving his Wife,” having completed
his task, disappears from the story and leaves her to pass
on his improvements, to the “nine young Ladies commited
to her Care.” She is “about forty Years old, tall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
and genteel in her Person, though somewhat inclined to
Fat,” and her “lively and commanding Eye” (more human,
if less hypnotic than Mrs. Mason’s) “created an Awe in
all her little Scholars, except when she condescended to
smile and talk familiarly with them.”</p>

<p>Theorists, working upon this Paragon, extracted the
more human elements; but the children escaped, like
Hop o’ my Thumb out of the Ogre’s house.</p>

<p>The long line of authentic portraits that extends from
Miss Fielding to Miss Edgeworth is of one family, and it
is doubtful whether any amount of “practical education”
could have improved some of Mrs. Teachum’s pupils,
restricted as these were to “Reading, Writing, Working
and all proper Forms of Behaviour”.</p>

<p>The naughty children in books, as in life, can take
care of themselves, but it needs a writer of unusual tact
to make the good ones live. Miss Fielding’s good children
are more to her credit than the “Rogues” who figure in
some of her best scenes; but there is nothing in the book
quite so amusing as her “Account of a Fray begun and
carried on for the Sake of an Apple, in which are shown the
sad Effects of Rage and Anger.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Teachum, entering unexpectedly, produces a sudden
calm in which the losses on all sides can be counted:</p>

<p>“Each of the Misses held in her right hand, fast clenched,
some Marks of Victory. One of them held a little Lock
of Hair, torn from the Head of Her Enemy, another grasped
a Piece of a Cap which, in aiming at her Rival’s Hair, had
deceived her Hand and was all the Spoils she could gain,
a third clenched a Piece of an Apron, a fourth of a Frock.
In short, everyone unfortunately held in her Hand a Proof
of having been engaged in the Battle. And the Ground
was spread with Rags and Tatters torn from the Backs of
the <i>little inveterate Combatants</i>”.</p>

<p>Here is a satirical scene not unworthy of Fielding’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
sister, yet not too subtle for her audience. (The Ladies
Caroline and Fanny, new to their titles, are visiting Miss
Jenny Peace.):</p>

<p>“Lady Caroline, who was dressed in a pink Robe embroidered
thick with Gold and adorned with very fine
Jewels and the finest Mechlin lace, addressed most of her
Discourse to her Sister, that she might have the Pleasure
every Minute, of uttering ‘Your Ladyship’, in order to
show what she herself expected. Miss Jenny, amused by
their insolent Affectation, addressed herself to Lady
Caroline with so many Ladyships and Praises of fine
Clothes as she hoped would have made her ashamed”.</p>

<p>Nobody who reads the book can suspect Miss Fielding
of more than a distant admiration for Mrs. Teachum.
Her own sympathies are clearly with the old dairywoman
who, when the children were rebuked for a want of tact
in their remarks to her, replied: “O, let the dear Rogues
alone, I like their Prattle,” and taking Miss Polly (the
youngest) by the hand, added: “Come, my Dear, we
will go into the Dairy and skim the Milk pans.”</p>

<p>There is a kind of story-telling, touched with the same
wise playfulness, which is not beyond the talents of
average aunts. Two such there were, sisters-in-law,
Dorothy and Mary Jane Kilner, whose stories, published
in Dutch flowered covers, were as popular after 1780 as
the earlier Newberys. There is some doubt about their
respective pseudonyms, but the family records ascribe the
signature “M. P.” to Dorothy and “S. S.” to her sister,
which establishes Dorothy as the author of <i>The Village
School</i>.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>Her stories grew naturally out of a happy and uneventful
life spent in the little Essex Village of Maryland Point,
and her best critics were the nephews and nieces for whom
she wrote. But she was in the habit of sending her books
to “the Good Mrs. Trimmer” for criticism, and it seems
likely that she wrote <i>The Village School</i> to help that lady
in her work of teaching poor children to read.</p>

<p>“M. P.” (she borrowed the initials of her village) is in
some sort a nursery Crabbe. There is not an incident in
her story outside a country child’s experience: no Babes-in-the
Wood opening, no clever animals, no romance of
improbable good fortune. This is the “clean pleasant
village” of every-day life. The schoolmistress, Mrs.
Bell, believes in simple virtues, but has no theories. Boys
and girls learn to read, and girls to spin, knit stockings
and sew. They are grouped quite simply, as in some old-fashioned
print, and M. P., having borrowed Miss Fielding’s
device of labelling them with symbolic names, uses it to
avoid the complexities of character. Jacob Steadfast
and Kitty Spruce are predestined to carry off the prizes
which Betsy Giddy, Master Crafty and Jack Sneak inevitably
lose; and a child is content with the main distinctions
of Good and Bad.</p>

<p>The story, slight as it is, reveals M. P. as an aunt who is
not indifferent to “Flowers picked out of the Hedges,
Daisies and Butter Flowers”; who can make garlands and
enjoy a singing-game,—the right sort of game for village
schools:</p>

<p>“You cannot think” she concludes, “how pretty it is
when they mind to sing and dance in the right time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>This was an aunt who, in her own century, deserved

</div>

<p><i>Jemima Placid</i>,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> variously ascribed to Dorothy and
Mary Jane, is woven of the same simple stuff. George
Frere, writing in 1816 to his brother Bartle<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, bore witness
to its practical effect on one nursery. They evidently
came to it in turn, at a particular age. “You”, he wrote,
“are more of a philosopher than I am and can bear these
things better, and yet I have read <i>Jemima Placid</i> since
you have, but you have made the best use of it”.</p>

<p>A Rousseauist might have overlooked the philosophy
in this little book,—the annals of a parsonage family, in
which all the characters are individuals and friends of the
writer; for there is not an ounce of theory in it. Jemima
herself is neither a pedant nor an infant prodigy. She is
never expected to reason about her own development.
Her philosophy is of the older sort that comes of gentle
discipline, and she is “placid” not through pleasing no
one but herself, but in spite of other people’s unjust or
exacting ways. It is doubtful whether she would have
been very different under the Eye of Mrs. Mason, but
assuredly she would have been less happy. No theoretic
Child of Nature ever was so happy as Jemima with her
brothers.</p>

<p>The scene of parting, when the little girl (six years
old) goes to London, is an introduction to these three:</p>

<p>“I wish you were not going” says Charles, “for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
I put this box and drove in these nails on purpose for you
to hang up your doll’s clothes, and now they will be no
further use to us.” William bids her not cry, and promises
to write about the young rabbits. “And, Jemima,”
adds Charles more tactfully, “I wish I was going with
you to London, for I should like to see it, ’tis such a large
place, a great deal bigger than any village which we have
seen; and they say the houses stand close together for a
great way and there are no fields or trees....”</p>

<p>It is the same village, seen from a different standpoint,
narrowed on the one hand to the record of a particular
house, on the other, varied by journeys and visits to town.</p>

<p>Old customs survive with the flowered covers of the
book, and the next few lines bring <i>Jemima Placid</i> into
touch with her predecessors. For in London there is a
great number of shops, and to be sure, among other things,
Jemima must bring back “Some little books which we
can understand, and which ... may be bought at Mr.
Marshall’s <i>somewhere in some churchyard</i>, but Jemima
must inquire about it.”</p>

<p>The little things that make up a child’s life happen with
natural inconsequence. What gives the book a hold is
the author’s unaffected truth and tenderness, the modest
philosophy which hides under simple speeches or
incidents.</p>

<p>Who but Jemima Placid, the unhappy guest of two
spoilt London cousins, could comfort herself under unjust
reproof with “the rough drawing of a little horse, which
Charles had given her on the day of her departure and which
she had since carefully preserved.”</p>

<p>It is no wonder that her brothers are loth to welcome the
Londoners on their return visit; but “S. S.” can make her
own “Book of Courtesy”, and she refreshes it with the
comments of real boys. William answers his father’s
rebuke with disconcerting logic: “You always tell me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
that the naughtiest thing I can do is to tell lies, and I am
sure I am very sorry they are come, for I like Jemima to
ourselves: so pray, Sir, what would you choose I should
do?”</p>

<p>There is not a trace of the “Juvenile Correspondent”
in Charles’s letters to Jemima; but the sentiment of
humanitarians is mere vapouring compared with this boy’s
account of how they found the dog shot by a game-keeper
and buried him under the Laylock tree.</p>

<p>“‘Poor Hector! I shall hate Ben Hunt as Long as I
live for it!’</p>

<p>‘Fy Charles’ said my father. ‘<i>Hector is dead, Sir</i>,’
said I, and I did not stay to hear any further.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth Sandham, who wrote somewhat later “for
the Children of former Schoolfellows”, claimed a wider
influence for the story of school life. “A school”, she
says, “may be styled the world in miniature. There the
passions which actuate the man may be seen on a smaller
scale.”</p>

<p>On this assumption, she ventured into the unknown
microcosm of a boys’ school,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> where even Miss Edgeworth
came to grief; but her book was a model for some hundreds
of school stories in which ambitious, studious or
mischievous boys play impossible parts. She was more
at home in a later study of schoolgirls<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>: careful sketches,
brightened by satirical remarks; but the moral is too
obvious. Miss Sandham’s sense of humour was too slight
for effective relief.</p>

<p>An admirable miscellany, which brings genuine adventure
and comedy into the school setting, is <i>The Academy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
r, a Picture of Youth</i>,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> published in 1808 by a Scottish
schoolmaster who, in his preface, claims to have taught
“all ranks, from the peer’s son to the children of the lower
orders.” His taste is hardly less catholic than his experience,
for he not only adds satirical and dramatic
scenes to the old fables and admonitions, but adapts
Berquin to an English atmosphere, and is ready to sympathise
with the shepherd, the labourer, the old man and
his horse. The book is a medley of old manners and new
sentiments, in which the characters, although they stand
for familiar types, earn some rights of personality by
individual acts and speeches.</p>

<p>This author is indebted to Smollett for a trick of making
his characters talk in the language of their callings.
Young Tradewell’s father consigns him to the Rector’s
care “per the bearer,” as if he were a bale of merchandise;
and a nautical father advises a son who has “gone a little
out of his course” to “sail clear of faults”, but if at any
time he is driven into them, to “be a brave boy and steer
honourably off.”</p>

<p>Satire in Children’s books is apt to miss its mark. Some
parents who bought this <i>Picture of Youth</i> must have felt
like the old gentleman of the story, who was furious at a
clever caricature of himself until somebody assured him
that it was intended for his neighbour. Restored to good
humour by similar means, they would doubtless enjoy these
burlesques: the foolish indulgent mother, the sporting
squire who laughs at his son’s escapades, the parents who
teach their boy “to recite passages with tragic effect
from our best poets”.</p>

<p>The Rector’s rational methods recall <i>Sandford and
Merton</i>; but the book is for older lads. The Bad Boy of
<i>The Academy</i> is more like a hero of Picaresque romance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
and the Good Boy (the son of a naval officer, destined for
the Service) is a new figure in moral tales; a pupil “highly
acceptable to the Rector” for his own sake; the more so,
perhaps, for the fresh memory of Trafalgar.</p>

<p>English people have an inherent power of reconciling
opposites, which perhaps comes of their being a mixed
race. The most revolutionary writers were held back by
some thread of ancient custom, and those who clung
to the older modes of thought were not without some
broadening influence. “Nature” and “Truth” were still
the accepted ideals of literature, although the meaning
of both had changed; and <i>The Juvenile Spectator</i>,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> which
applied Addison’s method of character-drawing to the
nursery, used it with a new understanding of childhood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arabella Argus,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> its author, adds piquancy to her
general scheme by introducing herself as a Grandmother.
Doubtless she was old enough to remember Lilliputian
traditions; but she was also too young to forget the newer
counsels of sanity and freedom. Like Addison, she begins
by describing herself and her aims, but so far is she from
admiring the model of the Baby Spectator, that she
directs her brightest satire against “little prodigies” and
child-philosophers.</p>

<p>She is “an old woman, but not an old witch nor yet a
fairy”; and without resorting to anything so irrational
as magic, she is able to set forth secret information upon
“Nursery Anecdotes, Parlour Foibles, Garden Mischief
and Hyde Park Romps”.</p>

<p>Now, a Newbery writer might have dealt with the first
two of these items; but he never could have countenanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
such portents of revolution as “Garden Mischief” and
“Hyde Park Romps”.</p>

<p>The letters which Mrs. Argus receives from children
show nothing like the decorum of the Goodwill Correspondence.</p>

<p>Here is one from a typical Bad Boy (which however,
Mrs. Argus contrasts with another, “couched in terms of
becoming timidity”, from a girl):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To Mrs. Argus,</p>

<p>“A friend of Mamma’s says that you are very clever
at finding out the faults of children, pray tell me mine,
for if you are as cunning as she says you are, I need not
mention them to you. I am certain I know you; don’t
you walk in the Park sometimes? I am sure you do,
though, and you have a very long nose; my sister Charlotte
and I hope you will answer this directly, for we are
in a great hurry to be satisfied about you.</p>

<p class="center">“Your’s</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Charles Osborn</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Argus gives sound and pleasantly pointed advice
in her replies, though she loses more than one laugh to
modern readers in her care for propriety.</p>

<p>“Will you be so good” she writes in one postscript “as
to tell your brother that the word <i>Thump</i> which occurred
in his letter appears to me an expression unworthy of a
well-educated child.”</p>

<p>Yet she surprises a pugnacious grandson with the novel
argument that so few things are worth fighting about;
and shows a genuine sympathy with boyish pranks.</p>

<p>Her remarks upon fairy tales are a juvenile version of
Addison on the “Lady’s Library”. She knows exactly
what sort of writing pleases some children; how “the
eager eyes of a little story-loving dame glisten with delight”
at a promising opening, and the lover of fairy tales “wishes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
just to gratify her curiosity, that there were really such
creatures as fairies”. Yet she is so far persuaded that
“an early course of light reading is very prejudicial to
sound acquirement”, that she rejects any story without
the hall-mark of a “Moral”.</p>

<p class="tb">A favourite device for connecting the haphazard events
of ordinary life (and one that embellished the bare truth)
was borrowed from current satires. <i>The History of
Pompey the Little; or, the Life and Adventures of a Lap-Dog</i><a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
became a model for stories in which an animal,
telling the story of its life, acts as an observer and critic
of human conduct.</p>

<p>Humanitarians and lovers of nature, taking up this
form, produced more or less faithful studies of birds and
animals; and critics who objected to fables, or thought
satire dangerous had nothing to say against this mixture
of Natural History and Morality.</p>

<p>Doubtless the stricter guardians of youth looked askance
at such a defiance of Reason; but the “Creatures” had
an immense influence in the Nursery: their morals were
vouched for by Æsop and all his tribe. After all, it was
only a new way of presenting the old lessons, and the
sternest parent could hardly reject so engaging a tutor as
a Robin or a Mouse.</p>

<p>Miss Fielding’s <i>Governess</i> had not a larger following of
School Stories than Mrs. Trimmer’s <i>Fabulous Histories</i><a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
produced in moral tales of birds and beasts. This little
book, better known by its later title, <i>The History of the
Robins</i>, was suggested by Mrs. Trimmer’s children, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
may account for its being her only imaginative work. The
children, taught during walks in the fields and gardens
“to take particular notice of <i>every object</i> that presented
itself to their view”, were able, by a natural process of
elimination, to develop a chief interest in animals, and
“used often to express a wish that their Birds, Cats, Dogs
etc., could talk, that they might hold conversations with
them”. Their mother, instead of rebuking them for so
irrational a desire, adapted the idea of talking birds to her
own theories of morality and for once managed to see
things from a child’s point of view.</p>

<p>Her own childhood had never been anything but middle-aged.
At ten she wrote like a grown-up person, and her
youth was spent in the company of people much older
then herself. Dr. Johnson, meeting her as a girl of fifteen
at Reynolds’s, was so much struck by her behaviour that he
invited her to his house next day, and presented her with
a copy of <i>The Rambler</i>.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> This may have had its effect
upon a style developed in formal “correspondence”
under her father’s direction; at any rate, her diction
remained pompous and conventional. Mrs. Trimmer
“composed” works as she “indited” letters. In “composing”
<i>Fabulous Histories</i>, she “seemed to fancy herself
conversing with her own children in her accustomed
manner”; but that was because she was accustomed to
converse, not talk.</p>

<p>The children, secure in the possession of a “kind pussy
Mamma”, never noticed it; to them it was the most
natural thing in the world that birds should converse in
the same way.</p>

<p>In their family relations, the robins are passable understudies
of the excellent Mr. and Mrs. Trimmer and their
children; but the introduction of a human family as their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
patrons and protectors restores them to the shape of birds.
For the first time in the history of children’s books, the
real centre of interest is transferred from the conduct of
children to such matters as living in a nest and learning
to fly.</p>

<p>Here is a good example of Mrs. Trimmer’s style:</p>

<p>“When Miss Harriet first appeared, the winged suppliants
approached with eager expectation of the daily
handful which their kind benefactress made it a custom to
distribute”.</p>

<p>On the human side, Mrs. Benson, a kind of domestic
Mrs. Teachum, presides over the morals of a son and
daughter. Her interest in education is almost equal to
Mrs. Trimmer’s, who “wearied her friends by making it
so frequently the subject of conversation”; but benevolence
softens her utilitarian morality. When Master
Frederick rushes to the window to feed his birds and forgets
to bid his Mamma good-morning, she admonishes him thus:</p>

<p>“Remember, my dear, that you depend as much on your
Papa and me for everything you want, as these little birds
do on you; nay, more so, for they could find food in other
places; but children can do nothing towards their own
support; they should therefore be dutiful and respectful
to those whose tenderness and care they constantly
experience.”</p>

<p>The Robin family is more than half human. Nestlings,
distinguished by the expressive names of Robin, Dicky,
Flapsy and Pecksy, exhibit all the faults of children. But
there is a world of difference between Mrs. Trimmer’s
treatment and that of the fabulist. She has learned to
look at a nest of birds from a child’s point of view; what
is infinitely more novel and surprising, she actually shifts
her ground and considers the Benson household <i>from the
standpoint of a bird</i>. It is here that so many of her
imitators lost the trail; and thus it is that their books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
were soon forgotten, while hers was read with delight for a
century.</p>

<p>The adventure of the nestlings and the gardener has
something of the fascination of <i>Gulliver</i>. This is Robin’s
description of the “Monster” who visited them in their
mother’s absence:</p>

<p>“.... Suddenly we heard a noise against the wall,
and presently a great round red face appeared before the
nest, with a pair of enormous staring eyes, a very large
<i>beak</i>, and below that a wide mouth with <i>two rows of bones</i>
that looked as if they could grind us all to pieces in an
instant. About the top of this round face, and down the
sides, hung something black, but <i>not like feathers</i>”.</p>

<p>The children dragged Mrs. Trimmer from her didactic
throne: they even made her talk their language. Her own
style is reserved for the parent birds, and in discussing
important matters, the young ones imitate them.</p>

<p>“This great increase of family”, says the Robin to his
mate, “renders it prudent to make use of every means for
supplying our necessities. I myself must take a larger
circuit.” The Mother bird thus addresses her penitent
son: “I have listened to your lamentations, and since
you seem convinced of your error, I will not add to your
sufferings by my reproaches.”</p>

<p>All this can be endured for the sake of so many delightful
incidents. For a child can climb up the ivy and creep under
the wing of the mother bird. He can join the nestlings
in their first singing-lesson, follow them in their first
flight, and best of all, he can look at the great world
beyond the nest with their wondering eyes:</p>

<p>“<i>The orchard itself appeared to them a world.</i> For some
time each remained silent, gazing around, first at one
thing, then at another; at length Flapsy cried out:
‘What a charming place the world is! I had no conception
that it was half so big!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p><i>The Life and Perambulation of a Mouse</i><a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> was Dorothy
Kilner’s contribution to the literature of talking beasts.
The author is discovered in a frontispiece, seated at a little
round table, in a mob-cap and kerchief. Her quill has
just reached the end of the second line. Erect in a box
of wafers, the Mouse, with extended paw, is dictating the
story of his life.</p>

<p>This “chief of aunts,” snow-bound in a country house
with many “young folk,” takes up her pen at their request,
to attempt her autobiography.</p>

<p>“I took up my pen, it is true”, she writes, “but not
one word toward my appointed task could I proceed....</p>

<p>‘Then write mine, which may be more diverting’, said
a little squeaking voice.”</p>

<p>Few “Introductions” were so promising, and the story
(apart from inevitable lessons) keeps its promise.</p>

<p>Four mice, Nimble (the narrator) and his brothers
Longtail, Softdown and Brighteyes, correspond to Mrs.
Trimmer’s nestlings; over whom, to a child’s mind, they
have one advantage: they are <i>outlaws</i>, repeating in
miniature the adventures of Robin Hood.</p>

<p>To be sure, they lack the outlaw’s chief virtues, for they
fly at the approach of an enemy, and rob rich and poor
alike. And although such creatures could always be
excused in the words of Dr. Watts:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>For ’tis their Nature too</i>,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">a problem remains to puzzle the wit of a little philosopher:
how it happens that creatures so keenly alive to human
errors are blind to the iniquity of eating a poor woman’s
cake, a present from her foster-son, or the solitary candle
that lights a poor man to bed. For indeed, these mice are
unsparing critics of cowardly, cruel and overbearing children;
they have a full repertory of moral and cautionary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
tales; they preach sermons on human courage and
honour.</p>

<p>The child of action puts aside all questioning, jumps
nimbly into a mouse’s skin and makes a fifth on these
marauding expeditions. He scuttles along behind the
wainscot, buries himself in the most delicious of plum
cakes, outwits the footman, narrowly escapes the trap and
thrills at his first sight of the cat.</p>

<p>In a mischievous mood, he can hide in a lady’s shoe,
or wake the children and hear them wonder what it
was. There are Eastern adventures to be had among
“spacious and elegant apartments”, where he can
choose from “a carpet of various colours” a flower that
will hide him, and crouch motionless at a passing footstep;
and when there is a price upon his head, or the house
catches fire, there are still more thrilling adventures of
escape.</p>

<p>Should a critic remark that these things do not make
up one quarter of the book, a child may tell him that he
does not mind sermons and, for that matter, can preach
them himself.</p>

<p class="tb">In 1798, one of the most realistic animal stories
appeared: <i>Keeper’s Travels in Search of his Master</i>,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the
adventures of a dog. Its author, Mr. Kendall, wrote other
books, mostly about birds;<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> but <i>Keeper’s Travels</i> was the
only serious rival to <i>Fabulous Histories</i>.</p>

<p>If any parent had scruples about talking beasts, here was
a book that could be put into a child’s hand with perfect
safety. No eighteenth century writer could help
making an animal reason as if he were human; but
this is a real dog, wagging and whimpering his way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
through the book, and if he does not speak, the story is
not a whit less interesting for that.</p>

<p>From the time that he loses sight of his master on a
market-day by being “so attentive to half a dozen fowls
that were in a basket”, his adventures are entirely natural
and probable.</p>

<p>Keeper is never too human for belief: he does nothing
that any dog might not do; yet he makes a good hero,—sticking
to his quest in spite of pain and hunger, refusing
comforts and saving the lives of children. Mr. Kendall
sums up his hero’s virtues in a quotation from Cowper,
for those who are “not too proud to stoop to quadruped
instructors”. He was not the only lover of animals to
quote a humanitarian poet. The author of <i>The Juvenile
Spectator</i> in her quaint <i>Adventures of a Donkey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> has these
lines from Coleridge below the frontispiece:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Poor little foal of an oppressed race!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I love the languid patience of thy face:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And oft with gentle hand I give thee bread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And clap thy ragged coat and pat thy head.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Autobiography of a Cat was a more delicate task,
a psychologist could not explain the workings of its mind,
although a careful observer might record its more intelligible
movements; but since every cat is a critic of human
character, there was nothing in the way of sermon or
satire that it could not achieve.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Sandham’s <i>Adventures of Poor Puss</i><a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> is a
very literal story, setting off the philosophy of “two
four-footed moralisers” on a sunny wall; but the anonymous
author of <i>Felissa; or, the Life and Opinions of a
Kitten of Sentiment</i><a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> produced a masterpiece in this kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>Felissa is a Kitten of Satire as well as of Sentiment.
This Author adopted the form of <i>Pompey the Little</i> in order
to ridicule cant and affectation in general, and Rousseau’s
doctrine in particular; yet the chief aim of the book (as
the title-page shows) is to turn a child’s thoughts from the
hackneyed problems of juvenile conduct:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The heroine’s pedigree goes back to Perrault; she actually
claims descent from “that noble, excellent and exceeding
wise Cat ... who owed his honours to the liberality and
gratitude of the celebrated nobleman the Lord Marquis
of Carabas”; and indeed she resembles her ancestor as
much in “Genius and Discretion” as she excels him in
Morals. She is one that might have sat on Dr. Johnson’s
knee; her remarks upon Rousseau would have delighted
him. Describing the Countess of Dashley, her little
mistress’s mother, she says that this lady “had been
advised by a French gentleman, one Mr. Rousseau, to
suffer her children to remain foolish till seven or eight
years of age, when, he said, they would grow wise of their
own accord”, a plan “so easy and delightful” that she
immediately adopted it.</p>

<p>Felissa’s satire has the prettiest effect of innocence.
One moment she is all kittenish mischief, the next, lost
in wonder at the lady of fashion who spares half a moment
on the way to her carriage to peep in at her little girl.</p>

<p>“For my part,” declares the Kitten, “my eyes were so
dazzled by her dress and her diamonds, and so alarmed
by some feathers that grew out of her head, in a manner
which I had never witnessed before, but in my old master’s
cockatoo at the Castle (and she never wore hers so high),
that it was some minutes before I could recover myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>The episode of a mock-christening, which recalls the
<i>Juvenile Tatler</i>, serves to change the scene. Felissa,
provoked to scratch, is sent down in disgrace to a country
Rectory, where she enjoys a quiet interval; but before
long, the Bad Nephew gets the better of the Good Midshipman,
and the kitten runs away.</p>

<p>She now seeks a refuge in the house of “the most
charitable woman living”, where, taking up her old part
of unconscious critic, she discovers that charity may be a
mere cloak for display; and coming thence to another
house, ventures into the library of a Man of Sentiment
whose portrait would have pleased Rousseau’s enemies.</p>

<p>“I crept behind a huge folio to recover my fright and,
as usual, set about rendering my person neat and attractive,
in expectation of soon becoming visible. My new
master, it was evident, could never have been instructed
on this subject; for as I peeped at him from behind my
folio, I thought that he was the dirtiest and most disagreeable
man I had ever seen in my life; and wished
from my heart, that my nice clean father and mother had
had the education of him. He was short and thick, and
by no means pretty; of an ill complexion, and his face
very far from clean; <i>all his skins</i>, likewise, were of a bad
colour, <i>both his shirt skin and his outer-skin</i>, which seemed
much out of repair....”</p>

<p>She is irresistible, this Felissa: reassured to find the
sentimentalist writing an <i>Ode to Mercy</i>; listening “with
her ears pricked up, <i>as if she had been watching for a mouse</i>,”
while he reads it to his daughter; puzzled by the extraordinary
fact that “the more she appeared distressed, the
more pleased her father seemed to be.” It is even more
unaccountable that a young lady of so much sensibility
should turn a starved kitten out of doors. “But kittens
are easily puzzled”, and Felissa runs into fresh adventures
on her way to a happy ending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>Her fortune is almost too modest for a descendant of Puss
in Boots: no more than the blessings of an Establishment
and many friends; but the chief of these is the daughter of
an officer “who lost his invaluable life in the memorable
battle which deprived our country of the gallant and
lamented Nelson.”</p>

<p>She, of course, marries the promoted Midshipman,
and the Kitten, having attained a certain seniority, and
finding little scope for her sly wit, devotes herself to the
instruction and amusement of little <i>Felissae</i>. If a story
could end better, let the Wyse Chylde show how.</p>

<p class="tb">Adventures of things, a variation of the same idea,
were mostly derived from Charles Johnstone’s novel,
<i>Chrysal; or, the Adventures of a Guinea</i>.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>If small coins might be supposed to talk as well as great
ones (and moralists saw no reason against it), a silver
Threepence,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> the equivalent of a guinea in juvenile commerce,
could relate transactions at the Village Shop or at
the corner of St. Paul’s Churchyard which, if less thrilling
than the Guinea’s, were more creditable to those concerned.</p>

<p>Other subjects of these stories had a greater fascination
for unworldly youth. These were things that a child would
play with or carry about: a Doll, a Pegtop or a Pincushion,
which, from their intimate association with the
family, were in a position to discuss its affairs.</p>

<p>“S. S.” designed her <i>Adventures of a Pincushion</i><a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
“chiefly for the use of young ladies,” little thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
old ones would turn back with delight to these records of
domestic life in their great-grandmothers’ time.</p>

<p>It seems that the proper place for a pincushion (that
essentially feminine possession) was the pocket; but
there were occasions, making for adventure, when it was
put into a workbag by mistake, or “lent to Miss Meekly
to fasten her Bib”, and then it was sure to be carried off
in another pocket to another house.</p>

<p>One effect of the book, unforeseen by its gentle author,
was doubtless to increase the number of lost pincushions;
for never, until it was published, had little Misses suspected
what secret critics and inveterate gossips they
carried about with them, disguised in harmless taffetas.</p>

<p>Rarely indeed is this watchful companion at a loss for
information, but once (when S. S. decides to skip a scene)
it remarks:</p>

<p>“The ladies now retired to dinner, but I am ignorant
of what passed there, as I was left upon a piece of embroidery.”</p>

<p>As for the woodcuts, they may well be John Bewick’s;
they follow each turn of the author’s quiet humour. Any
little Miss could tell at a glance that Martha was personating
the Music Master and Charlotte teaching the rest to
dance. These pictures show everything but the colours,
and for that matter, nobody shrank from painting the
Green Parlour, when the pincushion declared that “the
furniture was all of that colour”. Bewick Collectors
have never understood the fatal attraction of “plain”
cuts.</p>

<p>“S. S.”, justifying her simple narrative in a preface (and
thinking, perhaps, of <i>Chrysal</i>), admits that “the pointed
satire of ridicule might have added zest to her story”,
but thinks it unfit for children.</p>

<p>“To exhibit their superiors in a ridiculous view is not
the proper method to engage the youthful mind to respect.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
To represent their equals as objects of contemptuous
mirth is by no means favourable to the interest of good
nature. And to treat the characters of their inferiors with
levity, the author thought, was inconsistent with the
sacred rights of humanity.”</p>

<p>The criticism is a thought too serious. Ridicule is not
always a bad method of dealing with children’s faults;
“S. S.” herself could use it on occasion. Had she forgotten
the Wagstaffs’ party in <i>Jemima Placid</i>, or the
delightful mischief of the dressing of Sally Flaunt, in which
the Pincushion played a chief part?</p>

<p>It is really a question of treatment; a wooden sword
is sharp enough for the nursery. If children are simply
tickled by incongruities or miss the point altogether, it is
because the satirist has an eye on the grown-up part of his
audience. But, as “S. S.” points out, there is a danger
that incidents will be dragged in for satirical ends “without
any cause to produce them”; and, true to her own
simple canon of art, she decides “to make them arise
naturally from the subject”, though it increase the difficulties
of her task.</p>

<p>The Preface shows a concern for form which is rare in
these modest writers; and the method justifies itself.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary that so much food for profit and
enjoyment could be stored in the shelves of old-fashioned
houses.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOME GREAT WRITERS OF LITTLE BOOKS</span></h2>

<p>The fallacy of Disguise—Qualities of the “great” writers—Mrs.
Barbauld’s literary lessons: <i>Hymns in Prose</i>—<i>Evenings at
Home</i>—A new vein of romance—Charles Lamb’s attack on the
Schoolroom: Science and Poetry—The <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i>—“Lilliputian”
attitude of the Lambs—<i>The Adventures of Ulysses</i>—<i>Mrs.
Leicester’s School</i>—The Taylors of Ongar: Imagination and
spiritual life—Method of work—<i>The Contributions of Q. Q.</i>—“The
Life of a Looking Glass”—Mrs. Sherwood: the struggle between

</div>

<p>Disguise is of little advantage to a writer, least of
all to a writer of children’s books. For although
he has many invisible cloaks to choose from,
Sharp-Eyes and Fine-Ear are hot upon his track. They
recognise the pedant under his “Mask of Amusement”, they
judge the Moralist by the standard of his own Bad Boy, and
are no more impressed by the Perfect Parent or Tutor than
birds by a scarecrow, when once they have found out that
it is not alive.</p>

<p>A writer may be just as sincere in acknowledging the
reality of wonders as in finding matter of interest in everyday
things, if he express his own point of view; but the
maker of puppets or bogeys has given up his personality
and disguised his voice. He may be forgiven if he can
reveal himself at odd moments by individual gestures, as
the whimsical editor of a Lilliputian “Gift” would sometimes
peep out in his preface; no single lapse will be remembered
against him: the “Children’s Friend” atoned for
one little Grandison by many lifelike portraits.</p>

<p>But the great writers were those that lived most fully
in their stories. It was no more essential that they should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
write nothing else but children’s books than that a mother
should never go outside her nursery; for as every man
(unless he be a pedant or a monster) has something of the
child in him, so every child likes to enter into the talk and
business of men. There never was a good child’s book that
a grown-up person could not enjoy; and the habit of “talking-down”
to children, whether in books or in life, is more
fatal to understanding and friendship than the abstract
reasoning of the Lilliputians. When Johnson praised Dr.
Watts for his condescension in writing children’s verses,
he did him an injustice, for no man could have taken a
little task more seriously. As to Mrs. Barbauld,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> had she
deserved half the abuse of her critics, she never would have
found favour in so many nurseries.</p>

<p>De Quincey, who was evidently well-disposed towards
the “Queen of all the Blue-stockings” (in spite of her misguided
preference for Sinbad) says that she “occupied the
place from about 1780 to 1805 which from 1805 to 1835 was
occupied by Miss Edgeworth.” At any rate she was a
pioneer in the art of writing for children, and Miss Edgeworth
had a genuine admiration for her work.</p>

<p>But although there was a certain likeness in the aims and
ideas of these two, each had her own qualities, which were
the outcome of essential differences in character.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld had grown up among the boys of her
father’s school, and in her youth was as active and mischievous
as a boy. There is a story told of how she escaped
an importunate suitor by climbing an apple-tree in the
garden and dropping over the wall into a lane. Miss Edgeworth,
in the same situation, would have walked out by the
gate.</p>

<p>It is true that none of Mrs. Barbauld’s stories show this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
spirit of mischief: she was playful only in light verse or talk
or letters; but she made her personality felt in a romantic
attitude to life and Nature, which, although it did not
much affect her choice of subjects, made her style unusually
free and moving.</p>

<p>She had no children of her own, but adopted a nephew,
“little Charles”, for whom she wrote most of her stories;
and at Palgrave, where she and her husband had a school,
she was the mother, tutor and playfellow of the boys.</p>

<p>The tutor, indeed, comes out in all her stories; the playfellow
and the mother are not always there. Yet she was
dominated neither by facts nor theories. A deep sense of
spiritual truth underlay her teaching, and her feeling for the
poetry of Nature was the nearest approach to a Renaissance
of Wonder in children’s books.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether the famous <i>Hymns in Prose</i><a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
ever appealed to children as it did to their parents. Mrs.
Barbauld entirely disagreed with Rousseau’s principle that
there should be no religious teaching in early life, and that
a young child cannot appreciate natural beauties; but she
also rejected Paley’s crude idea of the Creator as a sort of
Divine Mechanic,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> which some writers preferred to the
neutral deism of Rousseau.</p>

<p>She held that children’s thoughts should be led from the
beauty of the flower to the wonder of creation.</p>

<p>“A child”, she says, “to feel the full force of the idea
of God, ought never to remember when he had no such
idea.” It must come early, with no insistence upon
dogma, in association with “all that a child sees, all that
he hears, all <i>that affects his mind with wonder or delight</i>.”</p>

<p>“Wonder” was a word unknown to educational theorists,
who believed that everything could be discovered or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
explained. It is her use of those words “wonder” and
“delight” which sets Mrs. Barbauld apart from other
writers of little books, for it shows something like the spirit
of romantic poetry.</p>

<p>The revealing power of the poet was never hers. She
feels, but cannot show a child as many wonders as he could
find for himself in the nearest hedgerow. The <i>Hymns</i> are
a kind of compromise between “Emblems” and pictures of
Nature. There are no far-fetched analogies: the parable of
the Chrysalis anticipates Mrs. Gatty;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and the language,
though rhythmic, is free from the conventional phrases
which spoil some of Mrs. Barbauld’s “prose-poetry.”</p>

<p>Any mother might use the same images to give her child
a first idea of the love of God:</p>

<p>“As the mother moveth about the house with her fingers
on her lips, and stilleth every little noise that her infant
be not disturbed; as she draweth the curtains around its
bed and shutteth out the light from its tender eyes; so
God draweth the curtains of darkness around us, so He
maketh all things to be hushed and still that His large
family may sleep in peace.”</p>

<p>But it was the Tutor in Mrs. Barbauld that made her
choose prose; for although she was a facile verse-writer,
she was better acquainted with Latin hexameters than with
ballads, and doubted whether children should be allowed to
read verse “before they could judge of its merit”.</p>

<p>Her best work is certainly in <i>Evenings at Home</i><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, the
popular miscellany which she and her brother, Dr. Aikin,
brought out in parts between 1792 and 1796.</p>

<p>“Sneyd is delighted with the four volumes of <i>Evenings
at Home</i>”, wrote Miss Edgeworth in 1796, “and has pitched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
upon the best stories—‘Perseverance against Fortune,’
‘The Price of a Victory’, ‘Capriole’”.</p>

<p>It would take an Edgeworth boy to amuse himself with
“The Price of a Victory”, a logical exposition which robs
soldiering of its romance; or with “Capriole”, the tale
of a little girl and her pet goat; but “Perseverance against
Fortune” fills a whole “Evening” with adventures that
most boys would read. The hero is sold as a slave, pressed
into the Navy and suffers many other hardships before he
succeeds as a farmer. Yet he is a mere type of the persevering
man. The story amounts to little more than a clear
statement of what happened, with pictures of what was
there. It was the matter of these tales that chiefly interested
Miss Edgeworth. She approved of arguments
against the cruelties of war, she wept with the little girl
over her lost pet, she heartily admired the good farmer for
his patient industry and liked to picture his fields, fenced off
from the “wild common”, his “orchards of fine young
fruit trees”, his hives and his garden.</p>

<p>Sneyd Edgeworth had had a “practical education” and
kept the family traditions. Another boy, perhaps, would
have chosen “Travellers’ Wonders,” though the traveller
confessed that he never met with Lilliputians, nor saw the
black loadstone mountains nor the valley of diamonds;
or, if these “voyages” were too tame, there were “The
Transmigrations of Indur”, adventures of a man, an
antelope, a dormouse, a whale,—centred in one person by
the mystery of transmigration.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbauld wrote without apology of “the time when
Fairies and Genii possessed the powers which they have now
lost”. Nobody reading “Indur” would suspect her of a
design to teach Natural History; but she never forgot her
profession and there are more lessons than stories in her
books.</p>

<p>The average boy would submit to a talk about Earth and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Sun, or Metals, or the manufacture of Paper, rather than
read “Order and Disorder, a <i>Fairy Tale</i>”, and doubtless,
in those days, boys were less impatient of Instruction;
but a lesson never can be a story. A hundred stories could
be written on Stevenson’s text:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The world is so full of a number of things.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m sure we should all be as happy as kings”;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but the authors of <i>Evenings at Home</i> chose instead the
encyclopædic ideal of “Eyes and no Eyes”, and produced a
series of object lessons. What was worse, Mrs. Barbauld,
in her anxiety to be clear, made the fatal mistake of “talking
down”.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb, writing to Coleridge in 1802, bitterly
resents her popularity: “Goody Two Shoes” he says, “is
almost out of print. Mrs. Barbauld’s stuff has banished
all the old classics of the nursery, and the shopman at
Newbery’s hardly deigned to reach them off an old exploded
corner of the shelf when Mary asked for them. Mrs.
Barbauld’s and Mrs. Trimmer’s nonsense lay in piles
about. Knowledge, insignificant and vapid as Mrs.
Barbauld’s books convey, it seems must come to a child in
the shape of knowledge; and his empty noddle must be
turned with conceit of his own powers when he has learnt
that a horse is an animal, and Billy is better than a horse,
and such like, instead of <i>that beautiful interest in wild tales</i>,
which made the child a man, while all the time he
suspected himself to be no bigger than a child. Science
has succeeded to poetry no less in the little walks of
children than with men. Is there no possibility of averting
this sore evil? Think what you would have been now, if
instead of being fed with tales and old wives’ fables in
childhood, you had been crammed with Geography and
Natural History!”</p>

<p>Lamb is so clear upon the main issue that he cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
just to the “instructive” children’s book. He loved the
tales of his own childhood, with their “flowery and gilt”
and all their delightful oddities.</p>

<p>For that, and because he understood the gentle humour
of the “Lilliputians”, he forgot whole pages of “instruction”
in <i>Goody Two Shoes</i>, and placed it on a level with
the “wild tales” of romance and adventure.</p>

<p>Had Mary and he read <i>Fabulous Histories</i> together, or
“The Transmigrations of Indur”, he might have allowed
some “old exploded corner of a shelf” to the schoolroom
authors; at any rate he would not have written:</p>

<p>“Hang them! I mean the cursed Barbauld crew, those
blights and blasts of all that is human in man and child!”</p>

<p>Science had succeeded to poetry. “The little walks of
children” ran through Botanical Gardens; but there is no
doubt at all that children, those amphibious breathers of
romance and realism, enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Lamb’s quarrel with the Schoolroom was something of
a paradox. He took the side of the Romantics against the
Scientists; and yet wrote children’s books at the suggestion
of the arch-theorist Godwin, who, as his publisher, naturally
had some influence upon his choice. It was doubtless
through Godwin that, instead of following the traditions he
admired, he began by “adapting” greater works, and went
on to write about children from a grown-up point of view.</p>

<p>The greater number of the <i>Tales from Shakespear</i><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
are Mary’s; but she and Charles lived and wrote in such
accord, that there is no marked difference in the style. His,
of course, are freer and more graceful.</p>

<p>“I have done Othello and Macbeth,” he writes to
Manning (May 10th, 1806), “and mean to do all the tragedies.
I think it will be popular among the little people,
besides money. It’s to bring in sixty guineas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>Now it is one thing to turn a child loose in an old library,—he
will forage for himself and will seldom choose any
but wholesome fare. It is quite another to provide him
with such stories as “Measure for Measure”, “Othello”
and “Cymbeline”; to simplify the philosophy of <i>Hamlet</i>
and weaken the grim magnificence of <i>Lear</i>.</p>

<p>The raw material of the plays would not attract many
children, and those who were ready for Lamb’s <i>Tales</i> might
have gone to Shakespeare himself.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that the Lambs were Lilliputian in
their attitude to children. Yet they were wise in their
generation; for in 1805 (when they began to write the
<i>Tales</i>) a boy of twelve was playing Romeo, Hamlet and
Macbeth to crowded houses at Covent Garden and Drury
Lane.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The “little people” of the day were incredibly mature.
To know them, in the delicate studies of Charles and Mary
Lamb, is to find the limits of Rousseau’s influence. For in
spite of the pioneer work of Mr. Day, and the activities of
the whole “Barbauld crew”, these were Lilliputians, the
children of Lilliputians. Lamb’s <i>Tales</i> must have been
infinitely more diverting than most of the books they read;
and if some, more childlike than the rest, flinched at the
tragedies, they could turn to the magician Prospero, the
fairies of <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, or the trial between
the Merchant and the Jew.</p>

<p>After all, the Lambs understood the vital qualities of
the stuff they used. Who would not choose these tales
rather than “The Price of a Victory”? They are not
lessons, but literature, and that is why children are still
reading them.</p>

<p>Lamb’s next venture was surer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“Did you ever read my Adventures of Ulysses,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> founded
on Chapman’s old translation of it?” he asks in a letter to
Barton, “for children or men. Chapman is divine, and my
abridgment has not quite emptied him of his divinity.”</p>

<p>A prose version of Homer, if he had gone straight to the
Greek, would have been still better; there was no good
reason for turning Chapman into prose, although Lamb
could do it gently.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Barbauld’s “nonsense” fades into insignificance
beside the matter of this book, and her remarks about
“wonder and delight” have not half the meaning of Lamb’s
phrase “<i>for children or men</i>.”</p>

<p>These were “adventures” that had been told in the
childhood of the Greek people. Lamb knew they were a
natural food for children, trusted his instinct and defied his
publisher.</p>

<p>In the matter of catering for children, Godwin was constrained
on the one side by his theories, on the other by
the parents who bought the books.</p>

<p>Not every parent professed his hard and cold philosophy,
but they were mostly concerned for morals, and if any
lacked interest in the more serious problems of education,
they were the more likely to be caught by some prevailing
pose of “Sensibility”. It did not follow, if they allowed
their children to read “Othello”, that they would approve
of the primitive survivals in Homer; nor did these in the
least agree with Godwin’s exalted theories of the uncivilised
mind. He would have had Lamb soften his account of the
Cyclops devouring his victims, and the putting out of the
monster’s eye, which Lamb called “lively images of shocking
things”. This is the point where Art and Theory must
part company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“If you want a book which is not occasionally to shock”,
wrote Lamb, “you should not have thought of a tale
which was so full of anthropophagi and wonders. I
cannot alter these things without enervating the book,
and I will not alter them if the penalty should be that you
and all the London Booksellers should refuse it.”</p>

<p>Lamb had good reason to trust his sister’s judgment
where children were concerned. Their partnership in the
making of little books was one-sided, and in a letter to
Barton, Charles confessed that he wrote only three of the
stories in <i>Mrs. Leicester’s School</i>:<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> “I wrote only the
Witch Aunt, the First Going to Church and the final story
about a little Indian girl in a ship”. But there are many
subtle touches in the rest which suggest his hand, and if
one may hazard a guess at their manner of working, Mary
wrote little that they did not first discuss together, and
revised much with his help. The framework of the book
is all that connects it with Miss Fielding’s <i>Governess</i>;
there is nothing of her bright objective treatment.</p>

<p>This, indeed, is not a child’s book at all, but a book of
child-thought and experience, full of insight and tenderness,
revealing everywhere the pathos of childhood.</p>

<p>Charles and Mary lived their childish days over again
in these stories. They forgot that as children they had
not seen things in the same light. They forgot (those days
had been short for them) that children, however precocious,
are not concerned with their own thought-process, but with
life and movement and adventure. And so their stories
are really essays about children: essays that let the grown-up
reader into some of the little people’s secrets. If it
were possible for children to see themselves with the eyes
of men and women, then <i>Mrs. Leicester’s School</i> might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
to them what the <i>Essays of Elia</i> are to their parents. As it
is, no child could appreciate the irony of innocence which
runs through the book like a refrain.</p>

<p>A suggestion of Wordsworth, in the story of “Elizabeth
Villiers”, can hardly be accidental. The little girl has
learnt to read from her mother’s epitaph, and her sailor
uncle, just home from sea, finds her in the churchyard
rehearsing her lesson.</p>

<p>“‘Who has taught you to spell so prettily, my little
maid?’ ... ‘Mamma,’ I replied; for I had an idea that
the words on the tombstone were somehow a part of
mamma, and that she had taught me.” The uncle, who
knows nothing of his sister’s death, asks for her and turns
in the direction of the house. “You do not know the
way, I will show you,” says the child, and she leads him to
the grave.</p>

<p>There is a similar pathos, not less beyond the insight of
most children, in Elinor Forester’s account of her father’s
wedding-day:</p>

<p>“When I was dressed in my new frock, I wished poor
Mamma was alive to see how fine I was on Papa’s wedding-day,
and I ran to my favourite station at her bedroom-door.”</p>

<p>But there is another motif in the book which, although
its chief appeal is to grown-up sympathies, might satisfy
a child’s love of contrast and surprise: the strangeness of
familiar things; the romance of the unromantic.</p>

<p>Emily Barton is a little Cinderella, carried off by her
father (whom she has forgotten) from the house of relations
who have neglected her. A postchaise takes the place
of the pumpkin-coach, a new coat and bonnet do humble
duty for a ball-dress.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, she jumps into the chaise “<i>as warm
and lively as a little bird</i>”. Mary Lamb has a store of
such tender phrases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>The home that most children take as a matter of course,
is a palace of delight to this little girl. Tea is a feast.</p>

<p>“Whenever I happen to like my tea very much, I always
think of the delicious cup of tea Mamma gave us after our
journey.”</p>

<p>The father and mother, loved by other children without
thought, are a King and Queen of romance:</p>

<p>“Mamma, to my fancy, looked very handsome. She
was very nicely dressed, quite like a fine lady. I held up
my head and felt very proud that I had such a papa and
mamma.”</p>

<p>A ride through the London streets becomes a royal
progress. In her exile, the child has had no toys: “the
playthings were all the property of one or other of my
cousins”. Now she appreciates the joy of ownership.
Not toys alone, but little books are purchased, and by a
mischievous turn, Mr. Newbery’s old device is turned
against his successors: “Shall we order the coachman to
the corner of St. Paul’s Churchyard, or shall we go to the
Juvenile Library in Skinner Street?”</p>

<p>This is far removed from the dramatic realism of the
Edgeworth School. It is the difference between the facts
and the poetry of everyday life.</p>

<p>There is more poetry (but less that a child would take)
in Charles Lamb’s story of the little four-years-old girl in
Lincolnshire and her “first going to church”.</p>

<p>The house is too far from a village for the family to attend
church, until they are able to set up “a sort of carriage”.
But the child is attracted by “the fine music” from the
bells of St. Mary’s, which they sometimes hear in the air.
“I had somehow conceived that the noise which I heard
was occasioned by birds up in the air, or that it was made
by the angels, whom (so ignorant I was till that time) I
had always considered to be <i>a sort of bird</i>.”</p>

<p>The bells calling Susan to church give the story a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
spiritualised Whittington touch. The ride to church and
the child’s first impressions are wonderfully described.</p>

<p>“I was wound up to the highest pitch of delight at having
visibly presented to me the spot from which had proceeded
that unknown friendly music: and when it began to peal,
just as we approached the village, it seemed to speak <i>Susan
is come</i>, as plainly as it used to invite me <i>to come</i>, when I
heard it over the moor.”</p>

<p>Here again, things that most children disregard, from
thoughtless familiarity, appear strange and delightful to
the lonely child. “All was new and surprising to me on
that day; the long windows with little panes, the pillars,
the pews made of oak, the little hassocks for the people to
kneel on, the form of the pulpit with the sounding board
over it, gracefully carved in flower work.”</p>

<p>Akin to this is the theme of changed fortune: privileges
only recognised when lost. It is the moral (never pointed
in these tales) of “Charlotte Wilmot” and “The Changeling”.
The child of the ruined merchant describes her
first night in the house of his poor clerk. The moon, often
watched in happier days, is now a symbol of misfortune:</p>

<p>“There was only one window in the room, a small casement,
through which the bright moon shone, and it seemed
to me the most melancholy sight I ever beheld.”</p>

<p>Poetry, not fact, is again the chief element in the story
of the “little Indian girl in a ship”. Her gentle, imaginative
sailor-nurse gives her no Natural History or Geography.
He turns her thoughts to “the dolphins and porpoises
that came before a storm, and all the colours which the sea
changed to”; she is never troubled about the genus of the
one or the causes of the other. If Lamb had set down this
sailor’s tales, as no doubt he would have told them to a
child, he could have made a real children’s book, of “the
sea monsters that lay hid at the bottom, and were seldom
seen by man; and what a glorious sight it would be, if our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
eyes could be sharpened to behold all the inhabitants of the
sea at once swimming in the great deeps, as plain as we
see the gold and silver fish in a bowl of glass”.</p>

<p>In the same way a visit to the country is not made the
subject of lessons on rural occupations or botany. As a
matter of fact, Grandmamma’s orchard is a fairy place
where pear-trees and cherry-trees blossom together, and
bluebells come out with daffodils. The profusion of these
flowers and the sound of their names might attract a child
that yet would miss the best touches:</p>

<p>“Sarah was much wiser than me, and <i>she taught me which
to prefer</i>.... I was very careful to love best the flowers
which Sarah praised most, yet sometimes, I confess, I have
even picked a daisy, though I knew it was the very worst
flower, because it reminded me of London and the Drapers’
Garden!”</p>

<p>Here Mary might have aimed a gentle shaft at the hated
instructive writers, who taught children “which to
prefer”; but there is no double intention in Sarah.</p>

<p>Only one story, “The Changeling”, has really dramatic
moments. There is a miniature <i>Hamlet</i> scene in this, a
“little interlude” played by children, which causes the
wicked nurse to betray herself. A child would enjoy it
better than the <i>Tales from Shakespear</i>. But the little
girl who frightens herself into believing that her aunt is a
witch is best understood by readers of “Witches and
Other Night-Fears”; little Margaret, reading herself into
Mahometism and a fever would be less interesting to small
folk than the book, <i>Mahometism Explained</i>, which she found
in the old library, “as entertaining as a fairy-tale”. The
humour is too subtle for children, they would enjoy the
picture of Harlow Fair better than that quaint account of
the grave physician puzzled over an extraordinary case,
“he never having attended a little Mahometan before”.</p>

<p>And so it is with the pictures of child-life. The grown-up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
reader has the best memory for Emily Barton (very
young indeed) at her first play. Emily herself remembered
that it was <i>The Mourning Bride</i>; but she was so far confused
between this “very moving Tragedy” and “the most
diverting Pantomime” which followed it, that she made a
strange blunder the next day.</p>

<p>“I told Papa that Almeria was married to Harlequin
at last, but I assure you I meant to say Columbine, for I
knew very well that Almeria was married to Alphonso;
for she said she was in the first scene.”</p>

<p>At the back of the grown-up mind, besides, there are
pictures to help in the reading. Charles and Mary, instead
of Emily Barton, reading the tomb-stones, looking up at
the great iron figures of St. Dunstan’s Church,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> or talking
over their first visit to Mackery End (too long ago for
Charles to remember); Mary at Blakesmoor with the old
lady who had “no other chronology to reckon by than in
the recollection of what carpet, what sofa cover, what set
of chairs were in the frame at that time”. Or John Lamb,
the father, taking a walk to the Lincolnshire village, “just
to see how <i>goodness thrived</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p class="tb">Ann and Jane Taylor cherished ideals clearer and much
simpler than the Lambs. They had no tragedy to darken
their youth; the struggle with poverty (very real at first)
was lightened by the cheerful co-operation of a whole
family. They were all engaged upon the father’s craft of
engraving; they all (father, brothers, sisters, even the
mother) wrote.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> They were “directed” (a phrase of their
own) by an unquestioning religious faith which simplified
and solved all the problems of life. The narrowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
influence of the village was counteracted by breadth of
intellect and by individual genius. There was, of course,
nothing to supply the generous education of London life,
or the exquisite literary discernment of the Lambs; but
Jane Taylor showed, even in her books for children, a
power of enjoyment and a sense of humour that is sometimes
associated with intensely serious beliefs. She was
untouched by popular philosophy, and adhered to the literary
traditions of the school of Pope; but the world of the
spirit was more real to her than earth itself; her work has
rare qualities of spiritual insight and imagination.</p>

<p>This does not apply, of course, to the simple rhymes
which were the sisters’ first literary venture. Mary Lamb
could make waistcoats while she was “plotting new work
to succeed the Tales”. The intricate process of engraving
demanded more attention. They were not free till eight
o’clock, and had household duties besides; but, as Ann
says, “a flying thought could be caught even in the midst
of work, or a fancy ‘pinioned’ to a piece of waste
paper.”</p>

<p>Some of the rhymes (there is more to be said of them)
were written too easily or too hastily to be of much account,
but there are points in favour of a method that makes
writing a relaxation, and allows no time for second
thoughts.</p>

<p>The <i>Original Poems</i><a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> have a spontaneity and freshness
that take a small child at once. The sisters never lost the
secret of writing for children, because they could always
think with them. Ann, the eldest, had mothered the
family, and afterwards brought up a family of her own; yet
she wrote at <i>eighty</i>: “The feeling of being a grown woman,
to say nothing of an <i>old</i> woman, does not come naturally
to me”.</p>

<p>Many writers (especially moralists) try to hold a child’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
attention beyond its power. Jane Taylor in this, as in
other matters, understands her audience.</p>

<p>“I try to conjure up some child into my presence, address
her suitably, as well as I am able, and when I begin to flag,
I say to her, ‘<i>There, love, now you may go</i>.’”</p>

<p>Jane was the genius of the family. “Dear Jane had no
need to borrow, what I could ill afford to lose,” said the
gentle Ann, of some good thing which had been attributed
to her brilliant sister.</p>

<p>The habit of “castle-building” caused Jane many heart-searchings.
She was as stern with herself as Bunyan; she
magnified all her little failings (or supposed failings) into
sins. “I know I have sometimes lived so much in a <i>castle</i>
as almost to forget that I lived in a <i>house</i>, and while I have
been carefully arranging aerial matters <i>there</i>, have left all
my solid business in disorder <i>here</i>.”</p>

<p>It was absurd, of course, to accuse a Taylor of disorder;
but the distrust of imagination was characteristic. She
valued imagination only so far as it interpreted spiritual
truth. The great difference between Jane Taylor and the
realists was that her reality had no connection with
materialism. To her, the life of the spirit was the greatest
reality. A thing was real or unreal according to its intrinsic
worth. Her sharpest satire was poured upon the material
benevolence of philosophy, “<i>the light of Nature-boasting
man</i>”, or the poet who could</p>

<p><i>The Essays in Rhyme</i><a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> are for grown-up readers, but they
state with perfect clearness the ideals that inspired her
work for children.</p>

<p>Under the pseudonym of “Q. Q.”, Jane Taylor contributed
for six years to the <i>Youths’ Magazine</i>,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and her best
pieces (afterwards collected) were “for children or men.”</p>

<p>“<i>The young are new to themselves; and all that surrounds
them is novel.</i>”</p>

<p>“Q. Q.” gives them short moral tales, full of point and
humour: really “entertaining” moral tales, and brilliant
little character-studies. They read, and begin to know
themselves. She introduces them to “Persons of Consequence”
(one, “little Betsy Bond, daughter of John Bond,
the journeyman Carpenter”). She sets forth a contrast:
the old Philosopher, so wise that he is humble, and the
Young Lady, just leaving School, who considers herself
“not only perfectly accomplished but also thoroughly
well-informed”; or the two brothers, one of whom writes
a clever essay on self-denial, while the other practises
it. Youth is left to judge between them.</p>

<p>The most arresting of these “Contributions”, “How it
strikes a Stranger”, inspired Browning’s poem “The Star
of my God Rephan.” A stranger from another planet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
finding himself upon Earth, is filled with interest and
wonder at what he sees. He enters readily into the pleasures
of the new life, and remains thoughtlessly happy till he
is faced with the unknown fact of death.</p>

<p>They refer him to the priests for an explanation.</p>

<p>“How!” he replies, “then I cannot have understood you;
do the priests only die? Are not you to die also?” When
he understands, he regards death as a privilege and refuses
to do anything “inconsistent with his <i>real interests</i>.” The
Adventure is described with a wonderful force of imagination;
but the lesson strikes upon youthful ears like the
voice in <i>Everyman</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Everyman, stand still. Whither art thou going,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus gaily?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some, not yet ripe for this encounter, would turn for
comfort to the bright and imaginative “Life of a Looking
Glass,” and revive their more childish interest in the
“adventures of things”.</p>

<p>The Glass, “being naturally of a reflecting cast,” would
catch, but not hold the restless attention of very little
persons. It was for those past the stage of actual belief
in talking things, who came back to it with a new perception
of imaginative correspondences.</p>

<p>The tranquil passage of the story (so perfectly adapted
to the “speaker”) is broken now and then by a flash of wit.
There is nothing extraordinary about the incidents: that
the writer admits; but she never fails “to give the charm
of novelty to things of everyday”, and chooses her pictures
not so much for moral ends as because they would be likely
to persist among the “reflections” of a looking-glass.</p>

<p>First, the large spider in the carver and gilder’s workshop
“which, after a vast deal of scampering about, began very
deliberately to weave a curious web” all over the face of
the glass, affording it “great amusement.” There is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
something in the responsive brightness of the thing that
gives immediate sanction to the idea of its being <i>amused</i>.
Then, the lively apprentice who gave it “a very significant
look”, which it took at the time for a compliment to itself.
And then a succession of images in quick movement
reflected from a London Street. “The good-looking people
always seemed the best pleased with me”, it remarks, with
a sly gleam, “which I attributed to their superior discernment.”</p>

<p>After this, the scene changes to one of almost lifeless calm;
the “best parlour of a country house, whose Master and
Mistress see no company except at Fair time and Christmas
Day.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should have experienced some dismay”,
remarks the glass, “if I could have known that I was destined
to spent <i>fifty years</i> in that spot.”</p>

<p>The younger the reader, the more endless such an interval
would seem; yet if any had patience to follow the tale at
its own pace, they might enjoy the fashion of that parlour:
the old chairs and tables, the Dutch tiles with stories in
them, that surrounded the grate, and the pattern of the
paper hangings “which consisted alternately of a parrot,
a poppy and a shepherdess—a parrot, a poppy and a shepherdess”.
The repeated phrase suggests the length of
days. “The room being so little used, the window-shutters
were rarely opened; but there were three holes cut in each,
in the shape of a heart, through which, day after day and
year after year, I used to watch the long dim dusty sunbeams
streaming across the dark parlour.”</p>

<p>Youth cannot wait for description, but these words
translate themselves into light and shade.</p>

<p>Here is the mistress of that parlour, ready dressed for
church on a Sunday morning, trotting in upon her high-heeled
shoes, unfolding a leaf of the shutters and standing
straight before the looking-glass. She turns half round to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
the right and left to see if the corner of her well-starched
kerchief is pinned exactly in the middle. The glass has
turned portrait painter. “I think I can see her now”, it
says, “in her favourite dove-coloured lustring (which she
wore every Sunday in every Summer for seven years at the
least) and her long full ruffles and worked apron”. Then
follows the master, who, though his visit was somewhat
shorter, never failed to come and settle his Sunday wig
before the glass.</p>

<p>Thus half a century goes by, with the imperceptible
movement from youth to age. The glass is reset in a gilt
frame to suit the fashion of new times; once more it
reflects young faces and vibrates with the laughter of
youth.</p>

<p>Jane Taylor could be didactic on principle, but she was a
true artist and knew that virtue is best recommended by
its visible effects.</p>

<p>The looking-glass, “incapable of misrepresentation,”
cannot help showing errors and vanities; but having
acquired “considerable skill in physiognomy”, discovers
more than the mere outside. Its last study is almost a
“Character”:</p>

<p>“There was, of course, in a few years, some little alteration,
but although the bloom of youth began to fade, there
was nothing less of sweetness, cheerfulness and contentment
in her expression. She retained the same placid
smile, the same unclouded brow, the same mildness in her
eye (though it was somewhat less sparkling) as when it first
beamed upon me ten years before.”</p>

<p>This is the Princess of the Moral Tale. She gives a last
glance at the looking-glass in her bridal dress, and leaves
it to its memories.</p>

<p>“Sometimes my dear mistress’s favourite cat will steal
in as though in quest of her; leap up upon the table and
sweep her long tail across my face; then, catching a glimpse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
of me, jump down again and run out as though she was
frightened.”</p>

<p>There is no “moral”, only this epilogue in dumb-show
to repeat the theme of change.</p>

<p>The humour of the looking-glass has an undersense of
pathos; but this is not the pathos of <i>Mrs. Leicester’s
School</i>. It would touch a child directly, like a picture without
words.</p>

<p>Books had no more to do with Jane Taylor’s love of
Nature than with her understanding of her fellow creatures.
She looked out of a diamond-paned window upon quiet
Essex fields and “a tract of sky”.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The sky, always the
most beautiful thing in a flat country, was to her more
productive than the soil of the realists. But she loved
gardens too, and caught the individuality of flowers. Ann’s
<i>Wedding Among the Flowers</i><a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> is less amusing than Jane’s
“fable” of the envious weed that shoots up till it overtops
the fence, and then, provoked by the beauty of the flowers
in the next garden, twists the chief beauty of each into a
defect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Well, ’tis enough to make one chilly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see that pale consumptive lily</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Among these painted folks.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Miss Tulip, too, looks wondrous odd,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She’s gaping like a dying cod;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What a queer stick is Golden-Rod!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And how the violet pokes!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Flowers are <i>persons</i> to Jane Taylor. She loves them as
friends: “the good, gay and well-dressed company which
a little flower garden displays”.</p>

<p>“Science has succeeded to poetry,” said Lamb. Jane
Taylor did not think them incompatible. Her “old retired
gentleman” could look at his garden from two points of
view:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“a part of the pleasure which now in my old age I
derive from my flowers arises, I am conscious, from the
distant yet vivid remembrance they recall of similar scenes
and pleasures of my childhood. My paternal garden seems
still to me <i>like enchanted ground</i>, and its flowers like the
flowers of Paradise. I shall never see the like again, vain
as I am of my gardening! Those were <i>poetry</i>, these are
botany!”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Imaginative power in the Taylors illuminated their
religious conceptions. In Mrs. Sherwood,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> it struggled
against the formulæ of rigid doctrine. From six to
thirteen, she learned her lessons standing in the stocks with
an <i>iron collar</i> round her neck. When it was taken off
(seldom, she says, till late in the evening), she would run
for half a mile through the woods, as if trying to overtake
her lost playtime. It says much for the quick recoveries
of youth that she was a happy child. Stanford Rectory,
where she spent her “golden age”, was surrounded by
woods and hills that seem to have become a part of her
before the iron collar was imposed. She built huts and
made garlands with her brother; they acted fairy tales
in the woods: tales of “dragons, enchanters and queens”.
She remembered her mother teaching them to read from “a
book where there was a picture of a white horse feeding by
moonlight”, a print of pure romance. She remembered the
wonder-tales told on dark winter evenings by “a person
vastly pleasant to children” who came across the park
“in a great bushy wig, a shovel hat, and a cravat tied like
King William’s bib”.</p>

<p>And yet, when she began to write books for children,
after some years of married life in India, she put on an iron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
collar of her own accord, to set forth the dire consequences
of Original Sin. When (perhaps late in a chapter) she
took it off, her imagination could conjure up no fairies;
but working upon the memories of her own childhood, it
brought life into the tale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood wrote an extraordinary number of
children’s books; many were published by Houlston the
Quaker as chap-books.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The sternest and most uncompromising
dogmatism cannot crush the life out of them,
nor weaken the vivid pictures they contain. Her first
journey across the hills to Lichfield, when she was a child
of four, had made a deeper impression on her mind than all
her Indian travels. She had fresher memories of the
English hills than of “the Indian Caucasus hanging as
brilliant clouds on the horizon”. The quiet inland life
that is the chief matter of her autobiography<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> is reflected
in most of her stories. She is not concerned with any wider
interests; great events pass unnoticed, as they do in some
nurseries; but whenever Mrs. Sherwood remembers her
Doctrines, she goes back to the Warnings and Examples of
the seventeenth century. There is a grim shadow on her
nursery wall, and in the midst of the most innocent employments,
her little people shrink and cower. This spectre
stood over her when she tampered with a book which
children of all ages understand and enjoy. She accepted
<i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i> as a part of her creed; her knowledge
of it accounts for the fine simplicity of her style.
Yet in her <i>Infant’s Progress from the Valley of Destruction
to Everlasting Glory</i>,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> there is not a giant nor a castle to
atone for her bane on “toys” which the strictest philosopher
would pass as harmless and instructive. Her poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
little pilgrim suffers a martyrdom of denial in a juvenile
Vanity Fair:</p>

<p>“Then I saw that certain of these teachers of vanities
came and spread forth their toys before Humble Mind,
to wit, pencils, and paints, maps and drawings, <i>pagan
poems</i> and <i>fabulous histories</i>, musical instruments of various
kinds, with all the gaudy fripperies of modern learning.”</p>

<p>Some of these things had been the delight of Mrs. Sherwood’s
youth; but in her passion for dogma, she forgot
the white horse and the fairy tales, and persuaded herself
that an iron collar was the only protection against vanity.</p>

<p>Her adaptation of Sarah Fielding’s <i>Governess</i><a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> shows the
same Puritan intolerance. The book had been in her own
nursery library, along with <i>Margery Two-Shoes</i>, <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i> and “two sets of fairy tales.” Yet she expurgated
all but one of the “moral” fairy tales allowed by Mrs.
Teachum, and inserted in their place “such appropriate
relations as seemed more likely to conduce to juvenile
edification.”</p>

<p>It is likely (and for her children’s sake to be hoped)
that Mrs. Sherwood’s practice was kinder and more cheerful
than her precepts. <i>The Fairchild Family</i>,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> the best
known, and the best of her books, is full of interest and
reality; and in this, the setting is her home and the persons
are her own children.</p>

<p>To enjoy it, a child must skip solid pages of doctrine,
and would do well besides to skip most of the stories read
by the Fairchild Family out of little gilt books which “the
good-natured John” brought them from the Fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>These were chap-books, but of a sort only less forbidding
than those the pedlar carried in Puritan days. John gave
the largest to Lucy and the other to Emily. “‘Here is
two pennyworth, and there is three pennyworth,’ said
he.</p>

<p>‘My book,’ said Emily, ‘is the History of the <i>Orphan
Boy</i>!<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>, and there are a great many pictures in it; the first
is the picture of a funeral.’</p>

<p>‘Let me see, let me see!’ said Henry, ‘<i>oh, how pretty!</i>’”</p>

<p>Late editors flinch at the inhumanity of the punishments,
and usually omit the gibbet story which, at the outset,
throws a horrible shadow on the book. There has been a
quarrel in the nursery; the children are penitent, they have
been forgiven; but Mr. Fairchild deems it necessary to
give them a concrete illustration of the fate of one who has
failed to control his passions. He takes them to “Blackwood”
(so far off that little Henry has to be carried) and
shows them the body of a murderer hanging from a gibbet.
“<i>The face of the corpse was so shocking that the children
could not look upon it</i>”.</p>

<p>It is to be supposed that children who survived this kind
of treatment could be happy, since there was little left to
excite their terror. Henry, when he steals a forbidden
apple, is threatened with fire and brimstone and locked up
in a dark room. The very frightfulness of all this would
defeat its end, for if a child could live through it, and look
up the next morning at an unclouded sky, or take his part
in the cheerful concerns of men, the thing would come, in
time, to have no meaning for him. It is clear that this
happened with the Fairchild Family. They act and talk
(save when they are made the mouthpieces of older persons)
like healthy and ordinary children. They even dare to be
naughty in an ordinary way. No sooner are Mr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Fairchild called away from home, than original sin begins
to assert itself. This chapter is “<i>On the Constant Bent of
Man’s Heart towards Sin</i>”.</p>

<p>Emily and Lucy play in bed instead of getting up:
“Emily made babies of the pillows, and Lucy pulled off the
sheets and tied them round her, in imitation of Lady Noble’s
long-trained gown.” There is no encouragement for the
dramatic games of children, any more than for dancing,
in Mrs. Sherwood’s books.</p>

<p>Then Henry announces hot buttered toast for breakfast;
they hurry down “without praying, washing themselves,
combing their hair, making their bed, or doing any one thing
they ought to have done.”</p>

<p>After breakfast they take out their books, but they have
eaten so much that they “cannot learn with any pleasure”.
A quarrel is checked by Henry’s discovery of a little pig
in the garden. The three at once give chase. Another
“juvenile” <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, this:</p>

<p>“Now, there was a place where a spring ran across the
lane, over which was a narrow bridge, for the use of people
walking that way. Now the pig did not stand to look for
the bridge, but went splash, splash, through the midst of
the water; and after him went Henry, Lucy and Emily,
though they were up to their knees in mud and dirt.” Mrs.
Sherwood had caught the live clearness of Bunyan’s pictures.</p>

<p>A neighbour (one of the unregenerate, whom the children
have been forbidden to visit) kindly dries their clothes;
she also regales them with cider, “and as they were
never used to drink anything but water, it made them quite
tipsy for a little while.”</p>

<p>The good-natured John, discovering their condition,
calls them “naughty rogues”. He gives them dinner
and ties them to their chairs, but afterwards relents and
allows them to play in the barn, where he thinks they can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
do no more mischief. Here they let down a swing which
they are only supposed to play with when Papa is present;
Emily falls out of it and narrowly escapes being killed.</p>

<p>At this point Mr. and Mrs. Fairchild quite unexpectedly
come home. The children fall upon their knees and fade
once more into unreality.</p>

<p>Thus Mrs. Sherwood replaces the iron collar after her
bursts of freedom. It is hardly a disguise. It does not
change her personality, it simply keeps her rigid.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Fairchild had enjoyed some interludes; but
that was when she was little and naughty. She actually
confessed to her Family that “a little girl employed about
the house” had tempted her on one occasion <i>to climb a
cherry-tree</i>.</p>

<p>Afterwards her aunts talked to her whilst she cried very
much. “Think of the shame and disgrace”, said they,
“of climbing trees in such low company, after all the care
and pains we have taken and the delicate manner in which
we have reared you!”</p>

<p>But she also remembered and quoted the words of that
“little girl employed about the house”:</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss, Miss! I can see from where I am all the
town and both the churches, and here is such plenty of
cherries! Do come up!”</p>

<p>This is a prose foretaste of <i>The Child’s Garden</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Maria Edgeworth was sixteen years old
when her father brought her to his Irish estate
of Edgeworthstown.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Her childhood had been
full of quiet preoccupations, and it argues much for the
impersonal methods of Mr. Day that, although he had
grounded her in Rousseau’s theory, she was in no way
dominated by it.</p>

<p>At Edgeworthstown, her ideas were brought into wholesome
touch with reality. The life was almost adventurous
after those quiet years in Oxfordshire and London. Her
father gave her a real share in managing the estate and
she was soon acquainted with many sides of Irish character;
but all her affections and interests were centred in
the family, and in this lay the secret of her power as a
writer of children’s books.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgeworth had brought up his eldest boy upon
Rousseau’s exact plan, a more unfortunate experiment
than Mr. Day’s; for this child of Nature would neither
teach himself nor learn from others; but his brothers
and sisters gained more than he lost by it: the system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
was modified for them, and Emile’s solitary employments
found a place among the cheerful occupations of a big
family.</p>

<p>The children were so happy and so busy that Mr. Edgeworth
could say in a letter to Dr. Darwin:</p>

<p>“I do not think one tear per month is shed in this house,
nor the voice of reproof heard, nor the hand of restraint
felt”.</p>

<p>He encouraged Maria to record their educational adventures,
and her own translation of <i>Adèle et Théodore</i><a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> may
have suggested the idea of a book. The two volumes
of <i>Practical Education</i>, published in 1798, with the names
of Richard Lovell and Maria Edgeworth on the title page,
mark the beginning of the long partnership which she
called “the joy and pride of my life”.</p>

<p>What her books might have been without her father’s
influence may be conjectured from what they are; this
is truer of the children’s books than of the novels. She had
no need of theory. Clear intelligence, warm and ready
sympathies, carried her straight to the centres of childish
thought. A little brother, Henry, had been her especial
charge, and from him she learned what might have escaped
her in the general business of the family.</p>

<p>She scribbled her first stories on a slate, read them to the
children and altered them to suit their taste. Those
they liked best were printed in 1796 at Mr. Edgeworth’s
suggestion,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and when the little outside public called for
more, fresh stories were produced on the same co-operative
plan and published in the six volumes of 1800.</p>

<p>“The stories are printed and bound the same size as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
<i>Evenings at Home</i>,” wrote Miss Edgeworth to her cousin
(Feb. 27, 1796), “but I am afraid you will dislike the
title; my father had sent <i>The Parent’s Friend</i>, but Mr.
Johnson has degraded it into <i>The Parent’s Assistant</i>, which
I dislike particularly from association with an old book of
Arithmetic called <i>The Tutor’s Assistant</i>.”</p>

<p>There is Geometry, if not Arithmetic, in the book. The
pattern is symmetrical: the tales are constructed to fit
the morals; but the Edgeworths recognised the chief
faults of didactic books for children, and made the first
definite attempt to deal with them.</p>

<p>“To prevent the precepts of morality from tiring the
ear and the mind”, says Mr. Edgeworth in the preface,
“it was necessary to make the stories in which they are
introduced in some measure dramatic; to keep alive hope
and fear and curiosity by some degree of intricacy.”</p>

<p>This is the best that can be done where the moral is so
explicit; and the device of intricacy serves to divert
attention from a too exact correspondence between cause
and effect.</p>

<p>In Miss Edgeworth’s clear and well-ordered world the
results of choice and action are inevitable; but her plots
(she was the pioneer of plot in children’s books) involve
a puzzle, and in the solution there is always an element of
surprise.</p>

<p>That Bristol merchant in “Waste Not, Want Not,”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
who invited his two nephews to stay with him, in order to
decide which of them he should adopt, bears more than a
chance resemblance to Mr. Day. If the two boys had been
girls, the story might have been his own; but in literature,
as in life, Mr. Day was prone to digress; he never could
have followed the relentless order of events from the
untying of the two parcels by Hal and Benjamin (the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Merton and Sandford of this drama) to its logical result.
There is a cumulative fatality about this which puts it
beyond question.</p>

<p>No sooner has the inconsequent Hal watched the careful
untying of Ben’s parcel, and cut the whipcord of his own
“precipitately in sundry places” than the uncle gives
them each a top.</p>

<p>“And now” (a child never could resist the interruption).
“And now, <i>he won’t have any string for his top</i>!”</p>

<p>The improvident one, however, finds a way out by
spinning it with his hat-string (the consequence of this is
deferred); and then, after whipping the banisters aimlessly
with the cut string, drops it upon the stairs. Little
Patty, his cousin, running downstairs with his pocket-handkerchief
(which he is in too desperate a hurry to
fetch himself), falls down a whole flight of stairs; and the
assiduous Ben, hunting for her lost shoe, finds it <i>sticking
in a loop of whipcord</i>.</p>

<p>For a time, the string theme is allowed to drop, but
it comes up again as a chief agent of the catastrophe.
Hal, on his way to the Archery-meeting stoops to pick up
his ball and loses his hat. (“The string, as we may
recollect, our wasteful hero had used in spinning his top”.).
Running down the hill after it, he falls prostrate in his
green and white uniform into a treacherous bed of red
mud, and becomes the laughing-stock of his companions.</p>

<p>Last and bitterest of all, he sees his prudent cousin
replace a cracked bow-string and win the contest by
drawing from his pocket “an excellent piece of whipcord”.
Not a reader but echoes, with additions, the unfortunate
Hal’s exclamation: “<i>The everlasting whipcord, I declare!</i>”</p>

<p>This single strand goes in and out with the shuttle-motion
of a nursery rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>This is the string that Hal cut.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>These are the Stairs</i></div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>That lay under the String</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>That Hal cut.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>This is the Child</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>That fell over the Stairs—etc.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With it are interwoven character-incidents that echo the
title-motto and harp on the note of Rousseau and Henry
Brooke: the choice of the two boys between a warm great-coat
and a green and white uniform, which culminates
with perfect logic in Ben’s loan of the despised coat to
cover Hal’s spoilt finery; and the minor choice between
queen-cakes and keeping one’s halfpence to give to a
beggar.</p>

<p>It is the strong point of Miss Edgeworth’s contrasts
that her bad children are never attractive, and her good
ones hardly ever impossible.</p>

<p>Hal is no villain; but there is no glamour about his
naughtiness: he is greedy and boastful as well as improvident;
a child is not moved to emulate him. The
real villains are dishonest or cruel or insolent, never simply
thoughtless or self-willed.</p>

<p>But the good children are a positive triumph. Only
Miss Edgeworth could make a boy live that untied knots
to save string, chose an overcoat instead of a gay uniform
and had money to spare for good works. This Ben is as
natural as his pleasure-loving cousin.</p>

<p>The moral, for all its insistence, never hides a picture:
the house, the Bristol streets and shops, the scene in the
Cathedral, where they listen to a robin that has lived there
for so many years; and Ben and his uncle admire the
stained-glass windows, but Hal looks bored. These are
drawn to the life.</p>

<p>“<i>Cannot one see a uniform and a Cathedral both in one
morning?</i>”</p>

<p>Every other boy in the Edgeworth family was a Ben,
and would endorse this catholicity of interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>It is odd that Miss Edgeworth’s “little plays”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> should
be among the least dramatic of her works. They were,
in fact, stories dramatised to fit the family “<i>théâtre d’éducation</i>,”
and the dramatist, intent upon her lesson, trusted
her little company to create their parts. The link with
Madame de Genlis is of the slightest, for although the
Edgeworth children were being educated more or less upon
the model of St. Leu, their plays and stories were not
in the least like any that Madame de Genlis had
written.</p>

<p>To Miss Edgeworth, truth was the first law of writing,
and she must have felt the want of sincerity that came
between Madame de Genlis and her books.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Her own stories are essentially dramatic; there is life
in every word of dialogue,—but the characters need no
artificial light. A painted background was a poor substitute
for her usual settings, villages that rang with the
sounds of honest labour, fields and orchards full of children:
a realist’s Arcadia.</p>

<p>The little town of Somerville (in “The White Pigeon”),
which in a few years had “assumed the neat and cheerful
appearance of an English village”, is in fact a picture of
Edgeworthstown. It is only when the writer allows her
characters to stray outside the bounds of her own knowledge
that the scenery begins to shake. Her school
stories would hardly convince an outsider;<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> the Neapolitan
setting of “The Little Merchants” is ludicrously
out of keeping with so moral a community.</p>

<p>But all this is nothing to a child. His interest centres<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
round the objects that make pictures in the mind, the
business he can imitate.</p>

<p>Berquin understood the practical interests of children,
but he had not Miss Edgeworth’s keen eye for things that
“draw”. The purple jar in the chemists’ window, the
coloured sugar-plums of the little merchants, the green
and white uniform. Berquin’s children were never so
independent as these. His orphans were adopted; Miss
Edgeworth’s keep house by themselves in a ruined castle,
and ply their trades of knitting and spinning and shoe-making
with the rhythm of a singing game. The finding
of a treasure among the ruins is a freak of romance that
holds the imagination even while the coins are being
weighed and marked.</p>

<p>Goody Grope, the old treasure-seeker who demands her
share of the orphans’ luck, is the only Irish study, but
other characters would connect these stories, if they were
not so frankly acknowledged, with the author of <i>Castle
Rackrent</i> and <i>The Absentee</i>: Mrs. Pomfret, that lesser
Malaprop, with her “<i>Villaintropic Society</i>” and “<i>drugs
and refugees</i>”; Mrs. Theresa Tattle; Mademoiselle
Panache, the milliner-governess, betrayed by her mouthful
of pins.</p>

<p>Emma and Helen Temple,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> drawn without reference to a
System, and left to develop each in her own way, would
pass for sedate and early types of “Sense and Sensibility”;
it pleased Miss Edgeworth the better that she could allow
a measure of sense to Sensibility.</p>

<p>She has many variants of these types: the wise sister
and playful brother; the well-informed brother with a
thoughtless sister, the wise or thoughtless one with a
foolish or a prudential family. Not one of them is quite
like any other. Nobody could mistake Laura, Rosamond’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
good sister<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> for the equally sensible Sophy, sister to
Frederick and Marianne.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Rosamond, with her filigree basket, would have repeated
the lesson of Charlotte and the watch, but unlike Charlotte,
she made the useless thing as a birthday present for
somebody else. The worst that can be said of Miss
Edgeworth’s young people is that they sometimes (from
the very reasonableness of their up-bringing) assume an
attitude of “civil contempt” towards ordinary folk.
They understand too soon the dangers that arise in education
from a bad servant or a silly governess, and are too
fond of arguments and encyclopædias. These are annoying
traits in otherwise natural and pleasant persons, for
although they are prigs in matters of knowledge or conscience,
they have a very sound sense of values and can
even be merry when it is not unreasonable to laugh.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott said that Miss Edgeworth was “best
in the little touches.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Children always find this out.
They love the robin that sings in the Cathedral, the child
that shared her bread and milk with the pig, the “little
breathless girl” who ran back to thank Simple Susan for
the double cowslips and violets, crying, “<i>Kiss me quick,
for I shall be left behind</i>.”</p>

<p>The smallest parts are played in character, in spite of
the didactic purpose and the clock-work plot. This story
of “Simple Susan” is not unlike a Kilner pastoral; but
the colours are fresher, the lines more definite.</p>

<p>“When the little girl parts with her lamb” said Scott,
“and the little boy brings it back to her, there is nothing
for it but just to put down the book and cry.”</p>

<p>But perhaps his great love of children made him read
more pathos into the story than is actually there. Few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
readers cry over these tales. They reflect the temper of
the Edgeworth family.</p>

<p><i>Early Lessons</i><a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> records the schooling of these children.
Maria had scarcely discovered “the warmth and pleasure of
invention” when her father recalled her to the Schoolroom.
She set about straightening her bright intricate
patterns to make reading books for the little ones, much
as Dr. Primrose’s daughters cut up their trains into Sunday
waistcoats for Dick and Bill.</p>

<p>To turn from the <i>Parent’s Assistant</i> to <i>Early Lessons</i> is
to agree with Byron that there ought to have been a Society
for the Suppression of Mr. Edgeworth.</p>

<p>And yet there is something to be said for these chosen
and deliberate little scenes. Acquaintance prospers
where there is no plot-interest to engross attention. The
“little boy whose name was Frank” steps as naturally
into the story as he would into a familiar room. He is so
obviously a real little boy that it is even possible to believe
in his virtues:</p>

<p>“When his father or mother said to him, ‘Frank, shut
the door,’ he ran directly and shut the door. When they
said to him ‘Frank, do not touch that knife,’ he took his
hands away from the knife, and did not touch it. He was
an obedient little boy.”</p>

<p>There is something arresting in this.</p>

<p>Frank’s doings and his sayings are a model of simplicity;
but nobody could say of him what Charles Lamb
said of Mrs. Barbauld’s little boys. As surely as any
critic is disposed to laugh at Frank, he finds himself watching
with involuntary interest while Frank pulls the leg of the
table, and finds out what would have happened to the
tea-cups if he had not been such “an obedient little boy”.
His adventures, moreover, are not all among the tea-cups.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
He is interested in a carpenter and in kites, and he has a
more than usually good eye for a horse. What really
distresses the reader is that he is never allowed out of
school; his most casual experience contributes to his
mental and moral advancement. Chestnuts, glow-worms,
the flame of a candle and other enchanting things are
impounded for object lessons. Frank’s father and mother
are his tutor and governess; the only poetry they mete
out to him comes from Dr. Darwin’s <i>Botanic Garden</i><a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, and
is “correlated” to Natural History; and after that it has
to be explained. For when Dr. Darwin sings of a moth’s
“trunk”, little Frank understands by that “a sort of
box”; when his mother repeats:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alight, ye beetles, from your airy rings”,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he asks (not without reason) “What does that mean,
mamma?” But the explanation would have come without
asking. The Governess is giving a lesson, the tutor is at her
elbow; and because you should never laugh in lessons,
it is all rather serious.</p>

<p>But here, as in every school, are the children; the
rest hardly counts. Here, for example, when a child has
made friends with Frank, is Rosamond, who will make
him forget all these lessons.</p>

<p>Readers of <i>The Parent’s Assistant</i> had met her before,
with a filigree basket. Here she is again, “about seven
years old”, walking with her mother in the London
streets, a very figure of childhood.</p>

<p>The mother disposes one by one of her bright interests:
The toys (“<i>all</i> of them”), the roses in the milliner’s
window, the “pretty baubles” in the jeweller’s shop.
And then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“‘Oh mother! oh!’ cried she, pulling her mother’s
hand; ‘Look, look! blue, green, red, yellow and purple!
O mamma, what beautiful things! Won’t you buy some
of these?’” (It was a chemist’s shop, but Rosamond did
not know that.)</p>

<p>Her mother answered, as before:</p>

<p>“What use would they be of to me, Rosamond?”
It is the purple jar that takes the child’s fancy. Driven to
invent a <i>use</i> for it, she thinks she could use it for a flower
pot, but that was no part of her desire.</p>

<p>The story of Rosamond and the Purple Jar was meant
to celebrate the usual triumph of the Perfect Parent;
but every child knows it is Rosamond who triumphs;
and this is the point where the Perfect Parent makes her
first mistake. She does not warn Rosamond, she only <i>hints</i>:</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if you were to see it nearer, if you were to
examine it, you might be disappointed”.</p>

<p>Now, Frank had his chance. They took away the tea-cups
before he let down that table-leaf. But nobody helps
Rosamond. The little reader follows, in close sympathy,
as she goes on unwillingly, keeping her head turned “to
look at the purple Vase till she could see it no longer”.
And as she goes, it transpires that her shoes “are quite
worn out”. That it should come to this, points to some
pre-arrangement by the Perfect Parent. The occasion
presents a unique opportunity for choice:</p>

<p>“Well, which would you rather have, that jar or a
pair of shoes?” The parental Economist cannot buy
both; she makes Rosamond understand that she will not
have another pair of shoes that month.</p>

<p>Thus the purple jar repeats the theme of the filigree
basket and the green and white uniform.</p>

<p>What Rosamond was never told, and what she could not
reasonably have been expected to deduce, was that the
beautiful purple colour was not in the glass. A child<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
cannot forgive injustice; all Rosamond’s friends (and all
children are her friends) cry out that it “wasn’t fair”.
They all say, “She wouldn’t have chosen the jar if she
had <i>known</i>”; and they are right. But the story goes on
relentless. Rosamond, sweet and unquestioning, survives
the whole painful experience and hopes at the end of it
that she will be “wiser another time”; but the Perfect
Parent has lost all the prestige she ever had with children.
She lost it before her callous and unintelligent question,
“Why should you cry, my dear?” But that sealed
her fate.</p>

<p>“I <i>love</i> Rosamond”, said a little twentieth-century girl,
not long ago, “but, oh, how I <i>hate</i> that mother!”</p>

<p>Miss Edgeworth drew none of her portraits from a single
original; but she often sat to herself for some part of them,
and at least one likeness was recognised by the family.
Writing in her sixtieth year to her aunt, of the “great
progress” she is resolved to make, she adds: “‘<i>Rosamond
at sixty</i>,’ says Margaret.”</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Harry and Lucy</i>, begun by Mr. Edgeworth and continued
at intervals with Maria’s help, was finished by her in
1825<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. The four volumes, she says, complete the series
of “Early Lessons”, in which Harry and Lucy had already
figured; but although her drawings of the two children
add colour to the book, it is really an oblation, on Mr.
Edgeworth’s behalf, to the Giant Instruction.</p>

<p>At this stage, it is true, there is a laboratory as well as a
museum in the giant’s castle; he can illustrate the marvels
of steam and suggest experiments with electricity. Yet
this is only a more practical Circle of the Sciences. The
children’s voices are trained to the question and answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
of a “Guide to Knowledge”; their lives are marked off
in lesson-periods. Even when a dull journey offers the
means of escape, these little captives hug their chains.
They never travel without books, and when there is nothing
to observe from the carriage windows, they find education
in the forests of the Oroonoko, where the plague of flies
affords “an inexhaustible subject of conversation.”</p>

<p>The “Grand Panjandrum” could never come better
than into this juvenile Cyclopædia.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Foote’s “droll nonsense” pleases Miss Edgeworth
chiefly because it was invented to test a man’s memory;
yet she can tolerate nonsense, at any rate when there is no
danger of its being confused with sense.</p>

<p>They are all there: “the Picninnies and the Joblillies
and the Garyulies, and the Grand Panjandrum himself
with the little round button at top.” Lucy laughs and
enjoys it, Harry calls it “horrible nonsense”; but their
father’s opinion is final, and Miss Edgeworth agrees with
him:</p>

<p>“It is sweet to talk nonsense in season. Always sense
would make Jack a dull boy.”</p>

<p class="tb">The didactic purpose, which hampers the story-teller
at every turn, becomes more irksome as an audience passes
from childhood into youth. Fixed patches of light and
shade appear unnatural; the critical eyes of youth are
open to devices that passed unnoticed in the nursery.</p>

<p>Miss Edgeworth’s <i>Moral Tales</i>, “for young people of a
more advanced age”,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> followed Marmontel into his own
province; but Marmontel drew his lessons from the world
as he found it; Miss Edgeworth fits her world to her
father’s theories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>Here again she has admirable portraits: the Quixotic
Forester, a new and convincing likeness of Thomas Day;
Angelina, that mirror of “romantic eccentricities”;
Mademoiselle Panache, little changed since her first appearance,
but here balanced by a “good French Governess”.
The unconscious satire of Lady Catherine is twice barbed:</p>

<p>“I don’t want to trouble you to alter his habits or to
teach him chemistry or <i>any of those things</i>.”</p>

<p>Yet here, as in <i>Early Lessons</i>, the persons walk gingerly,
after the manner of Berquin’s little boy who kept the
skirts of his coat under his arms, “for fear of doing any
damage to the flowers”. The paths of the Edgeworth
garden are purposely narrowed that their doings may
“neither dissipate the attention nor inflame the imagination.”</p>

<p>Miss Edgeworth’s books fitted into her busy life as a
natural occupation for long evenings. She wrote in the
common sitting-room with the family about her, not one of
them under any constraint, but talking freely, as if she had
been sewing instead of novel-writing. It was characteristic
of her that she could turn to children’s books in the
midst of the Defender troubles. An Irish rising claimed
no more attention than the play and laughter of the
children. She could refer to it in a letter, and pass on to
the next domestic detail without wasting a moment in
“useless reflection”. That is precisely the mood of her
stories. The <i>Moral Tales</i>, addressed to an emotional age,
do not merely ignore the common forms of “Sensibility”;
they take no account whatever of the stronger affections
and more vigorous manifestations of life: a thing scarcely
tolerable to generous youth. In the nursery books, this
equanimity has its uses. It enables her to deal with one
thing at a time, to select from a mass of details the particular
things that a child would waste time in choosing.
Nothing worries or puzzles her; she sees the world in clear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
and simple pictures, and reduces the inconsequent thoughts
of children to a relentless order.</p>

<p>Her little figures stand out in firm outline and bright
colour, and the background is interesting chiefly as it gives
occupation or the means of life.</p>

<p>Madame de Staël was thinking of the <i>Tales of Fashionable
Life</i>, when she said:</p>

<p>“<i>Vraiment Miss Edgeworth est digne de l’enthousiasm;
mais elle se perd dans votre triste utilité</i>”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. But it is not
less true of the children’s books.</p>

<p>Flowers in Miss Edgeworth’s garden (she is a true lover
of flowers) are beautiful symbols of human care and industry;
but they never encroach upon vegetables.</p>

<p>Rosamond was a rebel. “Mustard-seed, compared with
pinks, carnations, sweet-peas or sweet-williams, did not
quite suit Rosamond’s fancy.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Miss Edgeworth had chosen those flowers for Rosamond,
but the Perfect Parent knew better. When the sweet
thing planned a labyrinth of Crete “to go zig-zag—zig-zag”
through one of her borders, she was reasoned out of
it for the sake of some little green things that were going
to be mignonette, and when she and Godfrey were thinking
of digging a pond, a shocked voice cried:</p>

<p>“What! in the midst of your fine bed of turnips?”</p>

<p>Romance dies hard; but the odds were against Rosamond:</p>

<p>“And now, Mamma, <i>lay out</i> my garden for me, as Godfrey
says, exactly to your own taste; and I will alter it
all to-morrow to please you.” This would be Emily and
her mother over again, if it were not so like Maria and her
father.</p>

<p class="tb">Dealing with a criticism by her cousin, Colonel Stuart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Miss Edgeworth wrote: “I <i>know</i> I feel how much <i>more
is to be done, ought to be done</i>, by suggestion than by delineation,
by creative fancy than by facsimile copying”; but
she wisely stuck to her own method. It is where she
touches the magic circle that she is “spell-stopp’d.” When
Laura reads the fairy-tale to Rosamond (she is only allowed
<i>one</i>), her passage into an unreasonable world is marked by a
change of diction. The Edgeworth fairy is “inexpressibly
elegant”; her flowing robe is “tinctured with all the
variety of colours that it is possible for nature or art to
conceive”. But there is nothing supernatural about her.
She is merely a new specimen for the Museum, to be “contemplated
with attention”, like the others. The result,
recorded in a scientific note, proves her a creature of flesh
and blood:</p>

<p>“Small though she was, I could distinguish every fold
in her garment, nay, even <i>every azure vein that wandered
beneath her snowy skin</i>.”</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson and Miss Edgeworth took opposite sides
on this question of the supernatural; and since experience
proves that both were right, both must have been wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgeworth attacked the Doctor’s belief that “babies
do not want to hear about babies”, and Maria proved it a
fallacy; but neither disposed of his claim for “somewhat
which can stretch and stimulate their little minds.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edgeworth’s questions are not arguments: “why
should the mind be filled with fantastic visions, instead of
useful knowledge? Why should so much valuable time
be lost? Why should we vitiate their taste and spoil their
appetite, by suffering them to feed upon sweetmeats?”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Johnson could have answered him, and perhaps Mr.
Edgeworth knew it, for he adds:</p>

<p>“<i>It is to be hoped that the magic of Dr. Johnson’s name
will not have power to restore the reign of fairies.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>There was no great danger, so long as Miss Edgeworth
upheld the republic of common sense; but when at last
she laid down her pen, all the spirits whose existence she
had denied rose up and denounced her ineffectual
successors.</p>

<p>Thus she brings the first century of children’s books to a
natural close. She gathers up the loose ends of the old
stories and weaves them into a bright and symmetrical
design. The pattern is not wholly original: it was set by
Marmontel, followed by Berquin, attempted by Madame de
Genlis and the English Rousseauists; but Miss Edgeworth
brought it to perfection, expressing traditional themes in
terms of reason and benevolence.</p>

<p>The dramatic realism which marks her stories was the
keynote of English ballads and folk-tales; she found a
substitute for romance in the wonders of science. Roger
Bacon, that wizard of the chap-books, appears as a
forerunner of the Royal Society. Harry and Lucy know
him as the discoverer of gunpowder, the inventor of the
camera obscura, the prophet of flying-machines.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In Miss Edgeworth’s tales, science has not merely
succeeded to poetry; it has changed the enchanter’s instruments.
The Balloon is the new Pegasus, or the Flying
Horse of the Arabian Tales; the Magician still cries “New
lamps for old;” but it is Davy’s lamp that he carries.</p>

<p>Rosamond, when she cannot explore the India Cabinet,
is encouraged to look for wonderful things in her own
house; which indeed was Miss Edgeworth’s own practice.
Her “Enchanted Castle” was the home of her aunt, Mrs.
Ruxton,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and Aboulcasem’s treasure was not more marvellous
to her than a friend’s “inexhaustible fund of kindness
and generosity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>With the Lilliputians she had more in common than she
would have acknowledged.</p>

<p>“When I was a child,” wrote Mr. Edgeworth in the third
volume of <i>Early Lessons</i>, “I had no resource but Mr.
Newbery’s little books and Mrs. Teachum.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> He is too
conscious of the superiority of the new children’s books to
do justice to Mistress Two-Shoes; yet she, with her little
scholars and her weather-glass, was Miss Edgeworth’s
Lilliputian prototype. Simple Susan could have compared
notes with little Two-Shoes upon good and bad landlords,
and in some of Miss Edgeworth’s stories there are
prudential maxims that recall <i>Giles Gingerbread</i> and
<i>Primrose Prettyface</i>.</p>

<p>Some of Rosamond’s features may be traced in the
portraits by Miss Fielding, the Kilners and Mary Lamb.
The quaint miniature of Goody Two-Shoes has the same
grave intelligent look. If this little person, so wholly
unconscious of her charm, can be regarded as an
English type, then Emilie could not have been altogether
French.</p>

<p>Like Madame d’Epinay, Miss Edgeworth let Rousseau’s
lifeless image of the parent or tutor stand between her and
her readers. They listened to the talk of other children,
but seldom heard her voice. “Little touches” in the
<i>Letters</i><a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> would have made them better acquainted, for here
she spoke freely, showing both tenderness and humour,
making adventures of common incidents,—a journey or a
visit to friends.</p>

<p>“I nearly disgraced myself”, she wrote, after a visit to
Cambridge,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> “as the company were admiring the front of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Emmanuel College, by looking at a tall man stooping to
kiss a little child.”</p>

<p>This betrays her attitude to art and life.</p>

<p>If she never understood the “fairy Way of Writing”,
it was because she had built a school upon the fairy circles
of her village green. Her children were so happy in
and about the village that they never discovered an
enchanted wood. They planted trees instead of climbing
them; they knew all the roads to Market, but nobody
showed them the way to Fairyland.</p>

<p>When at last the “reign of fairies” was restored,
children burst into an unknown world of adventure and
poetry. Ever since that little boy of Shenstone’s suffered
for love of St. George, the fairies have fought shy of schools.
It remains to be seen whether they will hold their own with
modern pedagogues; but they are still in league with the
poets, and the understanding between them is this: that
the child, once having tasted fairy bread, can spend but
half his time upon solid earth. The rest he must have in
the Land of Dreams.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN OF VERSES</span></h2>

<p><i>The Spectator</i> on Gardens—“Cones, Globes, and Pyramids”—Good
counsels in rhyme—Verse in the Schoolroom—Didactic rhymes—Dr.
Watts’s <i>Divine and Moral Songs</i>—<i>Puerilia; or, Amusements

</div>

<p>“I think there are as many Kinds of Gardening as
of Poetry”, wrote the Spectator. His own garden
ran into the “beautiful Wildness of Nature”;
he valued it more for being full of blackbirds than of
cherries, and very frankly gave them fruit for their songs.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Nature, regarded as a landscape gardener of more than
ordinary skill, was even allowed to work under authority
in the domain of poetry; but she neglected one corner of
it, and there the trees were still clipped after the old
fashion into “Cones, Globes, and Pyramids.” This little
fenced-off portion was the eighteenth century Child’s
Garden of Verses. The only way out of it was by a narrow
gate in the midst of a Yew hedge, and of this only
good nurses kept the key.</p>

<p>In the lane outside, the pedlar hawked his wares; the
old ballads could still be heard, the seven lamps of enchantment
burnt bright at nightfall.</p>

<p>But inside the garden there were curious knots, with
flowers of the older sort and fragrant herbs. As time went
on, some of the trees were allowed to grow as they would;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
the open country could be seen through gaps in the hedge,
and the children began to make friends with travellers upon
the road.</p>

<p>Good counsels had run into rhyme from the beginning,
that they might hang together among wandering thoughts.
Thus might the <i>Whole Duty of a Child</i> be remembered.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
It gave, in short couplets, without figure, all the matter of
later exemplary and cautionary verse; and since the lines
were spoken in the person of the counsellor, there was a
certain dramatic interest added; for he that repeated the
lines assumed the part of Monitor.</p>

<p>This is one of the secrets of a child’s pleasure in didactic
rhymes. School, dull enough in itself, becomes a live thing
the moment it passes into the world of make-believe, and
words of caution and authority are a delight when spoken
in character.</p>

<p>Pedagogues and guardians of youth discovered in rhythm
and rhyme a means of teaching facts otherwise unrelated.
Emblem writers, feeling the weakness of their strained
symbolism, clutched eagerly at an effectual prop.
Emblems without verses had some measure of attraction,
for if no natural correspondence seemed to exist between a
hypocrite and a frog, or between an egg and a Christian,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
the things had an interest of their own, and excited curiosity
as to possible connections; but without rhymes, it
would have been impossible to pair them aright.</p>

<p>Verse, brought as an accessory into school, twinkled a
small mirror of imagination. Figures lurked in the letters
of the alphabet; rhymed riddles were to be had for the
piecing together of syllables. <i>A Little Book for Little
Children</i> (1702)<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> had these elements of interest; <i>The Child’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Week’s Work</i><a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> was further lightened by a wide uncurtained
schoolroom window, set so low that very small persons
could stand a-tiptoe, and get new lessons from the creatures
of earth and air. The very moderation of the writer invites
acceptance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come, take this Book</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dear Child, and look</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">On it awhile and try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What you can find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To please your Mind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The Rest you may pass by</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But most of it is too good to pass by; the moral is lost in
little phrases of real music, albeit the rhymer ties himself
to words of one syllable:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Birds in the Spring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do chirp and sing</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With clear, shrill and sweet Throats;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some hop, some fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some soar on high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Each of them knows its Notes.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hear you a Lark?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me what Clerk</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Can match her; he that beats</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The next Thorn-Bush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May raise a Thrush</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Would put down all our Wayts.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other “clerks” were appointed henceforth to the business
of instruction. Rhymed sermons grew up in the midst
of hymns of praise; these were marked by a forcible and
rousing emphasis. If the voice of the Pharisee be heard
no less distinctly than that of the Sluggard, in Dr. Watts’s
Divine and Moral Songs<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>, it rises at times into something
like a glow of patriotism:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I would not change my Native Land</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For rich Peru with all her Gold;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A nobler Prize lies in my Hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Than East or Western Indies hold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beneath the severity which his doctrine inspired, the
learned Doctor had a genuine tenderness for children, a
legacy not despised by the greatest and most revolutionary
of his successors, William Blake. His Cradle Hymn,
beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hush! my dear, lie still and slumber;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Holy Angels guard thy bed;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is remembered the better for Blake’s Cradle Song. In the
old conventional but rhythmic fashion, he too could sing
of lambs and children.</p>

<p>There is no answer to strictures on the more common
errors of the nursery; they are so obvious that admiration
halts before the power of rhythm that could give them life.
Here and there comes a thought fresh turned:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How proud we are, how fond to shew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our Clothes, and call them rich and new!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the poor Sheep and Silkworm wore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That very Clothing long before.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The old indiscriminate approval that gave Dr. Watts a
place of honour on the nursery shelf, started the
echoes along two centuries. Critics could neither silence
the triumphant march of the verse nor dispute a ring of
sincerity that it has.</p>

<p>Few poets of the old-fashioned Child’s Garden failed in
loyalty to its first planter; but editors made Lilliputian
anthologies and filled “Poetical Flower Baskets” from
other sources. Early in the new century, the author of
<i>The Butterfly’s Ball</i> fell by his frivolous choice from the
company of the elect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Butterfly, an idle thing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor honey makes, nor yet can sing.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">He encouraged a spirit of revolt, and talking beasts of divers
kinds broke into the garden.</p>

<p>Of the old order, John Marchant was welcome, despite
his lack of originality, for a trick of rhythm which he had
learnt from Dr. Watts, and apart from this, as a champion
of children’s games. He had “Songs for Little Misses”,
“Songs for Little Masters”, and “Songs”, varying the
martial beat of Dr. Watts, on “Divine, Moral and Other
Subjects”.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Children, he is persuaded, would be “delighted with the
Humour of them because <i>adapted to their own Way of thinking
and to the Occurrences that happen within their own little
Sphere of Action</i>.”</p>

<p>Stevenson could not give a more detailed picture
of these “occurrences”; it is in the region of childish
thought that his predecessor drifts into an uncharted sea.
He knows nothing of the little mythologies of children;
there are no imaginary countries, no “Unseen Playmate”,
no dreams. It is the difference between the old garden
and the new, which is of the child’s own planting.</p>

<p>There was a truant in the <i>Babees’ Book</i><a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> who sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I wolde my master were an hare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">&amp; all his bokis houndis were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">&amp; I myself a joly hontere.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the years between this and <i>Puerilia</i>, no child was
encouraged to put his own thoughts into rhyme; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Marchant’s “Little Miss” is heard “Talking to her Doll”,
“Working at her Sampler”, “playing on her Spinet”,
even “learning to dance”. The “little Master” of 1751
whips his top, flies his kite and goes a-birds’-nesting in
verse, when he is released from Arithmetic and the Languages.</p>

<p>But the world of Make-believe is still unknown to grown-up
travellers: a mystery jealously hidden by the child
from unsympathetic eyes.</p>

<p>A doll, in the matter-of-fact view of Mr. Marchant, is
a “mere painted piece of wood”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Legs thou hast, and tho’ they’re jointed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yet one Step thou canst not walk;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Head there is to thee appointed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yet thou canst not think or talk.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The rudest image could not be such a dead thing to a child.
The author is upon enchanted ground, and blind to all
its wonders.</p>

<p>He is safer following the needle in a child’s hand, tracing
the “odd and various” crochets upon a sampler, or drawing
a moral from the building of a “Pasty Pye”.</p>

<p>To music, whether of kit or spinet, he can keep time.
“Miss learning to dance”, in her saque and hooped petticoat,
is a bewitching figure, and the musician, though his
skill is not great, contrives not to put her out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How pretty ’tis to dance!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To curtsey and advance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wave about my Hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To sound of Kit.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My Steps true Measure keep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus lightly do I trip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Along the Floor I sweep</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With nimble Feet.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Master”, watching a Puppet-show, plays Gulliver at the
Court of Lilliput, surveys the “pigmy Troop” and makes
appropriate reflections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>A boy’s kite carries this quaint versifier for a moment
into the upper air. Even there his fancy cannot support
itself; he snatches a simile for the sake of the rhyme, then
takes a header to earth and fastens on his moral:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He that soars a Pitch too high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Riding on Ambition’s Wings:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sudden in the Dirt may lie;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Pride its Shadow ever brings.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the Kite actually rises, waving a “knotty Tail,” seeming
now “a little Cloud,” now “no bigger than a Spoon”;
the birds play round her or mistake her for a hawk, and the
boy, were his string long enough, “<i>would send her to the
Moon</i>.”</p>

<p>The rhymes of <i>Mother Goose’s Melody</i> and <i>The Top Book
of All</i> were wild flowers that sowed themselves in the midst
of herbaceous borders. Two garlands of folk-songs for
children grew out of the same soil. The date of <i>Gammer
Gurton’s Garland</i> is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> A Bodleian copy in flowered
covers has some rhymes from <i>Mother Goose</i>; but the most
daring “Lulliputian” would not have chosen the fairy
theme of impossible tasks:</p>

<p class="noindent">Ritson reprinted <i>Gammer Gurton</i>, with additions, in 1810;
but in the meantime an unknown editor had collected new
“Songs for the Nursery”,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and adapted them “to favourite
national Melodies”.</p>

<p>This is the biggest gap in the hedge. Here, at last, is the
open country,—the cuckoo’s song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent2">She sings as she flies;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">She sucks little birds’ eggs</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To make her voice clear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And never cries Cuckoo!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Till Springtime of the year.”,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the daffodil:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Daffy-Down-Dilly is new come to town</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a yellow petticoat and a green gown.”,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the song of the North Wind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The north Wind doth blow</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And we shall have snow</div>

    <div class="verse indent20">Poor thing.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is even more surprising to find, in this trim garden, a
nursery lyric that calls up the very spirit of child-thought:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How many miles is it to Babylon?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Three score miles and ten.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>There are no other songs like these. <i>The Poetical Flower
Basket</i><a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> represents the Lilliputian tradition that prevailed
between 1760 and 1789: rhymed fables, epigrams and
inscriptions from poets who never wrote for children, and
the story of “Inkle and Yarico” in verse.</p>

<p>Of Blake<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>, it is difficult to speak in such a company. He
was a winged thing hovering over little formal beds of
lavender, catching for a moment an echo of children’s
voices repeating the creed of “The Little Black Boy,”
dropping a tear for the Chimney-Sweeper, then flying off
unseen and unheard to sing his own songs of joy and love,
too much a child to suffer the interruptions of other
children; scarcely to be understood by those who were
dreaming their own dreams under the noses of the pedagogues.
A Pied Piper who never offered his services to
the community; a sublime truant from every school.
Of the realistic faith that could map out a Geography of
Heaven, he had no knowledge; yet Laws and Moralities
were the burden of some songs that had touched him.
There is a magic in the simplest form of verse that may
quicken the beat of a child’s heart, and endow little
forgotten rules and prescriptions of the nursery with
unexpected significance. If Blake could have alighted in
the starlight outside a window and heard Ann Taylor
putting one of her children to bed, he might have come
in and acknowledged the existence of naughtiness, just
for the pleasure of being forgiven. Some voices can
sweeten the longest homily, and the culprit waits patiently
for the kiss that must come when the sermon begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And has <i>my darling</i> told a lie?”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>There is a triumphant contradiction in so tender a
severity; a very rainbow of promise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do you think I can love you so naughty as this,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or kiss you all wetted with tears?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Idle Mary” can pass it all on to her doll. Later on,
when she looks down from the height of the first speaker,
she understands how forgiveness and hope came with a
sudden rush at the end:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>The authors of the <i>Original Poems</i><a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> wore the laurels of
Dr. Watts “with a difference.” They remembered all his
tunes, they played variations on most of his themes, but
they added songs of their own. In these, Walter Scott
caught a note of poetry, and wrote to thank “the Associate
Minstrels”. Miss Edgeworth, who cared less for rhythm,
praised them for other excellences. The songs were a
means of gentle intercourse between these writers and
“that interesting little race, the race of children” for
whom they had “so hearty an affection”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>The child of the new garden can join hands, “through
the windows of this book”, with the child of the old.
Ann and Jane and Adelaide were the great aunts-in-literature
of Louis Stevenson. A hundred years before
him they sang of stars and sun, of day and night and
play in gardens. The contrast is the greater because not
one or two, but all their poems turned upon “the whole
Duty of Children”. Instead of following a child “up
the mountain sides of dreams”, they were intent on
pointing out to him a world of greater Reality.</p>

<p>The dream world lies all about Stevenson’s “Garden”,
there is no hedge to separate it from ordinary roads and
rivers; they all lead to Fairyland. Yet this most practical
dreamer could speak in the very accents and call up the
<i>silhouettes</i> of his gentle predecessors at any moment.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read of “The friendly cow all red
and white”,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> without thinking of Jane Taylor’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thank you, pretty cow that made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pleasant milk to soak my bread.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The child in her garden looked up and wondered at one
star; that other child in the hundred-years-distant garden,
escaped at bedtime to watch “thousands and millions of
stars”.</p>

<p>Who would recognise the theme of Stevenson’s “Wind”
symphony, under the old title of “The Child’s Monitor”?<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
Yet the first two lines proclaim it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The wind blows down the largest tree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And yet the wind I cannot see</i>—”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The wind that brings mystery into the new Garden was
an emblem of human thought in the old. Stevenson’s
myth is a real product of the child mind:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O you that are so strong and cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O blower, are you young or old?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are you a beast of field and tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or just a stronger child than me?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There could be no such heathen explanation for Adelaide
O’Keefe. The Wind took shape as an allegory in her day:
it changed into the Voice of Conscience, it became an
ever-watchful angel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thus, <i>something</i> very near must be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Although invisible to me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whate’er I do, it sees me still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O then, Good Spirit, guide my will!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In another place the four elements are considered in a
modestly scientific light.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> They balance a juvenile version
of <i>The Seasons</i>. Nature is regarded from the old didactic
point of view. Spring, when “the Creatures begin their
employ” invites to industry; the Idle who in Summer
“love best in the shade to recline” are admonished by
the active joys of haymaking; the innocent hare is
remembered in the hunting season, and in Winter, Charity
sits by a glowing hearth and comforts itself with the
sophistries of Dr. Watts for the unequal distribution of
faggots.</p>

<p>These are but echoes; there are many touches that give
the personal records of keen and watchful eyes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I saw a leaf come tilting down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From a bare wither’d bough;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The leaf was dead, the branch was brown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No fruit was left it now:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But much the rattling tempest blew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The naked boughs among:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And here and there came whistling through</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A leaf that loosely hung.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="center">...</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I saw an old man totter slow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Wrinkled, and weak, and grey.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’d hardly strength enough to go</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ever so short a way.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The leaf and the old man had been seen and remembered,
the one for the sake of the other. There were times when
Ann, in her gentle way, came very near the heart of things.
The three could not have sung so well together if they had
not practised different parts. Jane, comparing her own verses
with the rest, modestly explained: “I allow my pieces to
rank as the <i>leaves</i> which are, you know, always reckoned
a necessary and even pleasing part of the bouquet.”</p>

<p>The comparison is hardly just, or if so, they are bright
leaves, more striking, though fewer than the flowers.</p>

<p>There is a crisp touch about her simplest work. The
verses are better turned than Adelaide’s or Ann’s. She
is content to take her subjects from the common stock
of moral tales<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>, to arrange her nursery pictures in twos
and fours; but in spite of convention, her “Morning”
is a Reveillé:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O come, for the bee has flown out of his bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To begin his day’s labours anew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spider is weaving her delicate thread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which brilliantly glitters with dew.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="center">...</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Awake, little sleeper, and do not despise</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of insects instruction to ask,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From your pillow with good resolution arise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And cheerfully go to your task.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“Evening”, the companion picture, is no more original;
in due order all the properties of Morpheus move before
tired eyes; sheep, and the parting linnet and the owl,
the setting sun, the friendly moon that peeps through the
curtain. Children know them all, and for that reason, the
cradle-movement of the verse is the more soothing. Conventional
portraits, “The Shepherd Boy” and “The Gleaner”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
stand out in clear simplicity, one on each side of the nursery
mantel-piece, as “Evening” and “Morning” go over the bed.
But when all the pictures are arranged, some of the figures
walk out of them and begin to dance upon the floor.</p>

<p>“The Creatures” are never mere moral messengers.
Jane has the same eye for character in beasts as in flowers
or children. “The Toad’s Journal” in <i>Q. Q.</i> is a better
example of this than any of her nursery pieces. This
“venerable reptile”, supposed to have been found alive
in the ruins of an Egyptian temple, records the events of
his <i>first thousand years</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Crawled forth from some rubbish and wink’d with one eye;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half opened the other, but could not tell why;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stretched out my left leg, as it felt rather queer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then drew all together and slept for a year.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awaken’d, felt chilly—crept under a stone;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Pull’d harder—then dozed as I found it no use;—</div>

<p class="noindent">The next sleep (“for a century or more”) gives time to

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To find a moral <i>when there’s none</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is hard indeed—<i>yet must be done</i>:”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The moral, just because “<i>there’s none</i>,” presses the unspoken
analogy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Age after age afforded him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wink an eye or move a limb,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Or hieroglyphic shapes to draw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More likely with his hideous claw;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such length of days might be bestowed</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Had his existence been eternal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What better could have filled his journal?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To go back to the Nursery (the Original Poets were scarcely
more than children when they wrote), Jane’s talking
beasts quickened the old stuff of fables by a new sense of
likeness and incongruity. The spider and his wife (Jane
loved spiders) are as real to a child as any married couple of
his acquaintance. He follows their fortunes with personal
concern; he would forego a feast to dine with them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One day when their cupboard was empty and dry</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His wife, (Mrs. Hairy-leg Spinner,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said to him, ‘Dear, go to the cobweb, and try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you can’t find the leg or the wing of a fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As a bit of a relish for dinner’”.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Cow and the Ass, meeting where the child may see
them on any summer day, reconcile nonsense and natural
history. The small actor can take both parts, and laughs
the more at his own drollery.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“‘Take a seat,’ cried the cow, gently waving her hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘By no means, dear Madam,’ said he, ‘while you stand.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then stooping to drink, with a complaisant bow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Ma’am, your health,’ said the ass:—‘Thank you, Sir,’ said the cow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus laughter crept into the garden under the eye of
Caution and Example, and, for his coaxing ways, was
allowed to stay as a probationer.</p>

<p class="tb">Charles and Mary Lamb wrote their <i>Poetry for Children</i><a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
as a task. It was probably suggested by Mrs. Godwin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
anxious to rival the publishers of <i>Original Poems</i>. In a
letter to Coleridge (June, 1809), Lamb says: “Our little
poems are but humble, but they have no name. You
must read them, remembering they were task-work; and
perhaps you will admire the number of subjects, all of
children, picked out by an old Batchelor and an old Maid.
Many parents would not have found so many.”</p>

<p>The Lambs could do nothing together without enjoying
it; they could not speak in a child’s voice, and had almost
forgotten the way to Babylon, but there are fewer subtleties
of child-thought here than in <i>Mrs. Leicester’s School</i>.
The verses are full of practical interests. The humour of
the writers brought tenderness and delight to the “task”,
and children, who are quick to catch the note of sympathy,
would feel this without understanding it.</p>

<p>Lamb had already tried his hand at children’s rhymes.
In 1805 he had written <i>The King and Queen of Hearts</i><a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>,
a careless and farcical impromptu which he sent by carrier
to “Mr. Johnny Wordsworth”, begging his “acceptance
and opinion”.</p>

<p>It is not easy to decide his exact share in <i>Poetry for
Children</i>. The pieces reprinted in 1818<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> are not children’s
poems. One of them, “To a River in which a Child was
drowned”, was suggested by the translation of a Spanish
ballad in Percy’s <i>Reliques</i>. “Love, Death and Reputation”
was recognised by Swinburne as a translation from
Webster’s <i>Duchess of Malfi</i>.</p>

<p>Lamb seems to have amused himself now and then by
casting fragments of mature flavour into this jar of nursery
simples.</p>

<p>Of children, but assuredly not for them is the beautiful
“Parental Recollections” which suggests understanding
as well as love:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The verses he would have repeated in that child’s company
were nonsense rhymes or metrical “wild tales”; not
without a song or two from Shakespeare (after the wise
example of Mother Goose); for he never could keep the
things he loved best out of talk or writing.</p>

<p><i>Poetry for Children</i> was written to fit parental ideals,
just as stories were sometimes invented to accompany
stock illustrations; yet Lamb’s gay humour played pranks
here and there, as in the gratulatory ode, “Going into

<p>And is not this a mischievous poet, that dares sympathise
thus openly with nursery vanities? A dangerous man,
with a tendency to romantic, unlawful sentiment. He places
the revolutionary effusion between two tender and wholly
innocent little poems of Mary’s.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> It should have been

<p class="noindent">Lamb’s instincts were all against the timid doctrine of
cautionary tales. A sermon is a thing that may be borne,
even enjoyed, at the appointed hour; but there is no
escape from regulations which cramp and restrict every
natural movement. Philip is not encouraged to eschew
games and concentrate on “little books”; he is not
warned on promotion that all the things he wants to do
are dangerous; he may play Baste the Bear, Leap-frog,
Foot-ball and Cricket, he may run in the snow, he may even</p>

<p>These were town-bred poets; Nature figures only in
side-glances. “The Ride” gives the town child’s delight
in fields, but two children are the real subject of the
picture. The Rainbow, regarded from a honeysuckle
bower, is sweet after a tempest, but it is a messenger of
earth: each precious tint is dear to Mary Lamb, “which
flowers, which fields, which <i>ladies wear</i>.” The robe of
Iris is unwoven to find the colours of gardens, of living
things, and of the human face. The magic bridge is
dissolved with “half of its perfect arch” yet visible.</p>

<p>“The Boy and the Skylark” is the most revolutionary
of these pieces. Bees and lambs, ants and silkworms, had
been noted for the docility with which they entered into
the business of human improvement. This sky-lark asserts
the independence of his race. He scorns the limitations
of human imagination which conceives of “the feathered
race” as serving the little ends of man. Richard, hearing
the lark’s song, confesses his sin, under the impression that
the “little bird” will betray him, as indeed Dr. Watts
and all Lilliput would have had him believe.</p>

<p>This, says the bird, is folly “fit to move a sky-lark’s
mirth.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Mrs. Trimmer would have been inexpressibly shocked at
this bird’s attitude; Ann Taylor would have been grieved
that he was not more friendly; Jane might have seen his
point of view. But this lark is a literal poet; there is no
attempt here to interpret a real ecstasy of song. The poem
is but an argument that hits a popular fallacy. This is
still the voice of the town and of common sense. The
Spectator might have said as much for the birds that
sang in his cherry trees.</p>

<p>There is only one fairy in <i>Poetry for Children</i>; fairies,
like dreams, were outside the pale of the Garden. This
one is a spirit of the age, but springs from the brain of a
child. Little Ann was a friend of Mary Lamb’s, and knew
what the poet “prettily” wrote about Titania; but
because she had not been admitted to fairy Society, it was
entirely natural that she should project into fairyland the
most diminutive creature of her acquaintance (an Edgeworthian
method of setting imagination to work upon
experience) and describe the “fabulous being” to her friend:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘You’ll confess, I believe, I’ve not done it amiss.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Pardon me,’ said Matilda, ‘I find in all this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fine description you’ve only your young sister Mary</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Been taking a copy of here for a fairy.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is a thrill of adventure in the true tale of a child
that took an adder for a “<i>fine grey bird</i>”, and shared with
it, in perfect fearlessness, his breakfast of bread and milk;
children laugh over the odd choice of the little Creole who
saw a crowd of dancing chimney sweepers on a May
morning, thought they were his fellow countrymen, and
became ambitious for a sooty coat. These stories could
have been told as well in prose; but the charming fancy
called “The Desert” is a feast of the nursery muse:</p>

<p class="noindent">Studies of children, in the warm and tender colouring of
personal reminiscence, are the chief matter of the book;
children do not appreciate the love and insight that makes
it poetry; they will not stand still to trace, in these
portraits of brothers and sisters, a likeness to the gentle
authors. Grown-up persons, acquainted with the family
history, understand the little girl’s patience over her
broken doll and her studied kindness to “dear little craving
selfish John”.</p>

<p>There is a bending-down in many of the poems that
only grown-up persons understand; the writers stoop to
conquer childish reserve, not at all in the disconcerting
manner of Wordsworth, though they sometimes adopt his
way of recording the result:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">His sister out in it the fields to view.</div>

incidents:</p>

<p class="noindent">Mary Lamb’s poem “The Two Boys”, quoted by Lamb in

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p class="noindent">This is an unexpected link with Stevenson; the proprietor
of the shop “which was dark and smelt of Bibles” (that
quaint store-house of romance)<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> is a reincarnation of this
bookstall man; he repeats the old growl in prose:</p>

<p>“I do not believe, child, that you are an intending
purchaser at all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>To compare these verses with Stevenson’s is to discover
an essential difference. The Lambs had the same delight
in memories, but they looked back with tenderness to a
childhood which they had been forced to leave behind.
Stevenson was a boy to the end. The Child in his Garden
is heard singing his own deeds. These gentle Olympians

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet in another rhyme, the monitress relents, and indulging
the idle fancies of Robert, allows him, though late for
breakfast,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">There is not enough of this to make a book of children’s
poetry. Romance knocked timidly at the gate and tendered
a moral as the price of admission; but it would be a dull
child that could not find him somewhere in this corner of
the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>The two small volumes had a short life; some of the
pieces were reprinted in collections, but the book failed to
hold its own against Mr. Roscoe’s bright fancy, <i>The
Butterfly’s Ball</i><a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>, written for the birthday of his little boy
Robert, and set to music by order of their Majesties for
Princess Mary.</p>

<p>Children responded with one accord to the invitation
of the first couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come take up your Hats, and away let us haste</div>

<p class="noindent">Here was an entertainment which made no demands on
attention or understanding, which had no “moral”; it
was all pure enjoyment. The rhymes were as simple as
any in <i>Mother Goose’s Melody</i>; the pictures, early efforts
of Mulready’s<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>, presented the various creatures in glorious
independence, no more constrained by laws of proportion
than the inhabitants of a willow-pattern landscape. They
come, a gay and irresponsible procession, with a hint of
fairy-land for all their reality:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“A Mushroom their table, and on it was laid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A Water-Dock leaf, which a Table-Cloth made.”</div>

<p class="noindent">There is “the sly little Dormouse” and “his blind Brother
the Mole”; the Frog (found still in the same attitude by
Alice in Wonderland) and the Squirrel, who watches the
feast from a tree. The rest are mostly winged:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The Harlequin Spider performs feats on the tight line, a
giant Bee hovers over an absurdly inadequate hive, a snail
bigger than either offers to dance a Minuet; and at
nightfall the Watchman Glow-worm is ready with his
light.</p>

<p>The feast is soon done, but for a third reading it can
be got by heart.</p>

<p>“A Sequel”, <i>The Peacock “At Home”</i>,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> appeared in
the same year, with a frank and humorous acknowledgment
of its predecessor’s success. A pleasing mystery
about its authorship was solved some years later in the
preface of “<i>The Peacock and Parrot on their Tour to discover
the Author of ‘The Peacock At Home’</i>.”</p>

foreigners, such as the Taylor Bird and Flamingo, were
guests of the Peacock. They offered a variety of absurd

<p class="noindent">Bewick’s beasts and birds forsook their natural haunts
and danced in the most carefully preserved parterres.
They came in their thousands, of all sizes and nationalities.
“W. B.” followed Mrs. Dorset with <i>The Elephant’s Ball</i>,
and the Season was extended till all “the Children of
Earth and the Tenants of Air” were exhausted. Children
ran out of the Lambs’ quiet parlour into a garden of perpetual
Feasts. What could come better after the Butterfly’s
Ball than a Wedding Among the Flowers?</p>

<p>But there was still an old-fashioned lady, one Miss
Elizabeth Turner, who held aloof, wielding the rod of
Dr. Watts. With the perversity of their race, the Lilliputians
fell into step as they approached her, and listened
to her warnings with a fearful joy. She told them, in
simple numbers, how Miss Sophia would not wait for the
garden gate to be opened, and demonstrated by her fall,

<p class="noindent">Poor Jane and little Tom excited a thrill as “cautionary”
Babes in the Wood. They succumbed to the fatal fascination
of scarlet berries:</p>

he bungled the thing. But when other children cried, it

<p>The names of her two little books<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> have no obvious

<p class="noindent">But names are pictures to a child: daisies and cowslips
should have a place in his garden. In open defiance of
the calendar, these were succeeded by <i>The Snowdrop</i> and
<i>The Crocus</i>. Mary Elliott suffered herself to be turned
by the Muse from Precept and Example; she added <i>The
Rose</i><a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> to this serial garland. Little feet went willingly
after her, for she led the way through a village, and visited
many friends. At the window of the village shop they
loitered together, forgetting all the penalties of pleasure-seeking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>

disguised as poets. Wise children saw through the
deception at once; others, lured into encyclopædic mazes,
yawned while the guide recited “Edward, or Rambling
reasoned on”,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and described the delights of town for the

the Pedlar at the door. He is singing new rhymes to old
tunes: <i>Whimsical Incidents</i>, <i>Cinderella in Verse</i>, <i>Mother
Hubbard</i>, <i>Dame Trot</i> and <i>Goody Flitch</i>.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The Lady of
Ninety who wrote <i>Dame Wiggins of Lee</i><a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> must have heard
him singing in her youth.</p>

<p>Nonsense rhymers, whipped out of the Court of Stupidity,
found a refuge in the purlieus of the child’s garden;
nobody recognised them as descendants of the citizens of
Cockayne, or suspected that they would one day be
honoured as predecessors of Edward Lear. Yet who shall
gauge their influence on the character of Englishmen, or
decide how far the eccentricities of certain theorists
depended on the exclusion of nonsense from the nursery?</p>

<p>The History of the <i>Sixteen Wonderful Old Women</i><a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> came
too late for Mr. Day:</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">While Mr. Edgeworth was “explaining” poetry to children,
and later, when Young Reviewers were being taught to
“dissect poems”,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> the Pedlar was still singing for truant
minds. If he knew nothing of poetry, at least he knew
enough to let it alone; and his songs were good to dance
to, which every child knows is an excellent thing in songs.</p>

Hereford and Norfolk”, or with famous
battles. “King Henry Fifth’s Conquest of
France” probably belongs to the reign of
George I.</p>

<p class="hanging">(b) “The Blind Beggar’s Daughter” was

<div class="appendix">

<p>There is a list of great men given in <i>The
Tatler</i> (No. 67), Sept. 13, 1709; and in No. 78,
one Lemuel Ledger writes to put Mr. Bickerstaff
in mind of “Alderman Whittington, who began
the World with a Cat and died with three hundred
and fifty thousand Pounds sterling”.</p>

<p><i>The Spectator</i> (No. 5) March 6, 1711, says
that “there was once a Design of casting into
an Opera the Story of Whittington and his Cat,
but that Mr. Rich abandoned the Idea for Fear
of being overrun by Mice which the Cat could
not kill.”</p>

<p>Suspicion seems to have been cast on the cat
in the second half of the century, and it is
interesting to find Goldsmith (“On Education”,
1759) advocating instead of romances “the old
story of Whittington, <i>were his cat left out</i>” as
“more serviceable to the tender mind than
either Tom Jones, Joseph Andrews, or a
hundred others, where frugality is the only good
quality the hero is not possessed of”.</p>

<p>Mr. Wheatley in his <i>Chap-books and Folk-lore
Tracts</i>, notes that in 1771 the Rev. Samuel
Pegge brought the subject of Whittington and
his Cat before the Society of Antiquaries, “but
he could make nothing at all of the Cat”.</p>

<p><i>The Persian Tales, or the Thousand and One
Days</i> appeared in 1714, and was followed in the
same year by <i>The Persian and Turkish Tales
Compleat</i>.</p>

<p>The pseudo-translations of Gueullette were
translated into English in 1725, as <i>The Chinese
Tales, or the Wonderful Adventures of the

<p>To this was added “The History of little Tom

<p>This was the earliest edition known to Mr.
Welsh; but an edition of 1752 was afterwards
discovered and noted in <i>The Times Literary

Sales”. This seems to be the first edition of
<i>Tommy Trip’s History</i>; but an earlier account
of him is given in <i>The Lilliputian Magazine</i>,
first advertised in 1751. Goldsmith came to
London after his travels on the Continent, in
1756, so that he could not have written <i>Tommy
Trip</i>, although the rhyme of “Three Children”,
as Mr. Welsh observed, is remarkably like the
“Elegy on a Mad Dog”.</p>

story of his childhood only), published about
1814 by Pitts of Seven Dials, with a foreword
to the “little Friends” for whom it was
designed.</p>

<p>Plays were also fashioned into children’s
books. Garrick’s Masque from Dryden’s <i>King
Arthur</i> (1770) produced a “Lilliputian”
romance closely modelled on Dryden: <i>The

<p>In an enveloping cautionary story, there is
some account of a gigantic Twelfth Day Cake;
but the book consists chiefly of “Pieces”,
which include the story of “Inkle and Yarico”,
taken by Addison from Ligon’s <i>Account of
Barbados (Spectator</i>, No. 11), “versified by a
Lady”, Addison’s hymns; Pope’s Universal
Prayer; “The Progress of Life”, an Eastern
story from the <i>Rambler</i>; Parnell’s “Hermit”;
the character of Antiope from Fénélon’s <i>Telemachus</i>,
translated in 1742, and the King’s
speech to Westmoreland (Henry V. iv. 3),
a sign of the revived interest in Shakespeare.</p>

<p>This is almost a perfect specimen of the

of those numerous and popular little books for
the amusement and instruction of children
which have been ever since received with
universal approbation. The Lilliputian histories
of Goody Two-Shoes, Giles Ginger-bread,

of the benevolent minds of the projectors
of this plan of instruction, and respectable

<p>The Masquerade was “occasioned by the

<p><i>A Father’s Memoirs of his Child</i>, by Benjamin

by a child from his third to his seventh year
(1798-1802).</p>

<p>The little boy, Thomas Williams Malkin, born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
in October, 1795, died when he was seven. His
father, beginning the <i>Memoirs</i>, says: “It is not
intended to run a parallel of his infancy with
that of Addison in his assumed character of
Spectator, who ‘threw away his rattle before he
was two months old, and would not make use of
his coral until they had taken away the bells
from it’”; but the disclaimer proves that he
was conscious of the parallel.</p>

<p>On his own showing, he had made the child
into a “little Philosopher” who never had so
much as a rattle to throw away, whose first
toy was a box of letters. The boy’s letters
show a pathetic struggle between natural
simplicity and the artificial system on which
he was being trained. Some are more precocious
and pedantic than any in <i>Juvenile
Correspondence</i>.</p>

stilted “epistolary patterns” was shown
earlier in the childish letters of Mrs. Trimmer

<p>Canning deals with the Newbery books much
as Addison does with the ballads, though
Canning’s classical parallels are not serious.
He begins by recommending to novel-readers,
instead of “the studies which usually engross
their attention”, the “instructive and entertaining
Histories of Mr. Thomas Thumb, Mr.
John Hickathrift and sundry other celebrated
Worthies; a true and faithful account of
whose adventures and atchievements may be
had by the Curious and the Public in general,
price two-pence gilt, at Mr. Newbery’s, St.

John Marshall’s sign of the “Great A and
Bouncing B”.)</p>

<p>He identifies “Tom Thumb” with Perrault’s
“Little Thumb”, and draws a parallel between
that hero and Ulysses; and between the Ogre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
and Polyphemus, comparing the incidents in
a mock-heroic vein. There is no trace of the

which exercised a kind of censorship over

encouraging envy, jealousy, vanity and other

<p>In the preface to <i>The Adventures of Ulysses</i>,
Lamb says: “This work is designed as a
supplement to the Adventures of Telemachus”;
and in a letter to Manning (1808) he says it is
“intended as an introduction to the reading of
Telemachus”.</p>

<p>Fénélon’s <i>Télémaque</i> (1699) which, like his
<i>Fables</i> and <i>Dialogues des Morts</i>, was written
for his pupil, the grandson of Louis XIV, was
translated into English in 1742. It is a kind
of sequel to the fourth book of the <i>Odyssey</i>,
describing the further adventures of Telemachus
in search of his father. Fénélon
turned his “adventures” into a moral tale,
and Lamb, in his preface, also lays stress on the
moral of his book.</p>
